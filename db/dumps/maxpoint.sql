579	87	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C. &ndash; May 16, 2012 &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>On the heels of BIGinsight&rsquo;s research report released yesterday titled &ldquo;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/GroceryShopperInsights?campaign_id=70130000001rlQF&amp;source=pressrelease\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer</a>,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a> today revealed the results of an on-site survey conducted at&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.fmi2012.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">FMI2012</a> - which found discrepancies between grocery executives&rsquo; insights around digital advertising and actual consumer behavior. More than 100 food retail industry executives were polled on changes they&rsquo;ve seen in the shopping behaviors of the post-recession consumer. MaxPoint found that only 20 percent of respondents think consumers use digital mediums to prepare for their shopping trips. However, BIGinsight&rsquo;s research found that 90 percent of consumers regularly research products online before purchasing them in store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a post-recession economy, consumers are trying to find the best ways to maximize their monthly spend. Some of these news habits as reported by the Grocery Industry Pulse: &ldquo;Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer,&rdquo; include: shopping at multiple stores to find the best prices and deals, a heavier reliance on coupons and sales and an increase in research on digital channels before making an in-store purchase. To compare these findings, executives at FMI2012 were asked how they&rsquo;ve seen their shoppers&rsquo; behaviors change in the past year to determine if they are using the most effective methods to reach today&rsquo;s grocery shopper. Key findings from the survey conducted on the show floor include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Executives are Aware that Consumers are Shopping Multiple Grocery Stores</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Consumers can expect to see increased incentive to complete their shopping in one location, as approximately 35 percent of grocery executives recognized that shoppers have become less store-loyal and more cost-conscious.</li>\r\n\t<li>Approximately 15 percent of respondents said that consumers are more frequently shopping at discount stores and club stores like Costco and Sam&rsquo;s Club.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Consumers are Shopping Closer to Home </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Approximately 30 percent of respondents recognized that consumers now tend to shop at grocery stores closest to their home.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Coupons and Sales Aren&rsquo;t Going Anywhere </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Approximately 32 percent of executives shared that they have seen an increase in the use of print coupons, while 31 percent have seen an increase in the use of digital/mobile coupons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Splurging Has Taken a Backseat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>20 percent of executives shared that &ldquo;splurging&rdquo; on items at the grocery store has been cut back. They said consumers are just buying what is needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;As more consumers are increasingly using digital mediums to prepare for their in-store shopping experience, it was interesting to see a varying point of view from grocery executives around these changing shopper behaviors,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint. &ldquo;The combination of our research and BIGinsight&rsquo;s report provide great insights into how consumers now make purchasing decisions and the role that digital plays in those decisions. We&rsquo;ve learned that consumers are doing more research online before buying in the store, shopping closer to home and are highly influenced by incentives and coupons. Grocery retailers should take these key points into consideration as they build new marketing and advertising campaigns.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a copy of the full research brief, please click&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/GroceryShopperInsights?campaign_id=70130000001rlQF&amp;source=pressrelease\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo see the full results of the FMI2012 on-site surveys please click&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpointinteractive.com/maxpoint-asks-fmi-attendees-how-have-you-seen-consumer-grocery-shopping-habits-change/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the Grocery Industry Pulse: Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer</strong><br />\r\nReaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer is derived from the BIGinsight&trade; Monthly Consumer Survey, February 2007 through February 2012 (Average N = 8,500), the Media Behaviors &amp; Influence&trade; Study, December 2011 (N = 24,578) and the MaxPoint Cost Conscious Grocery Shopper Survey, March 2012 (N = 1,006).

551	73	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C.</strong> <strong>&ndash; October 30, 2012 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<u><a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a></u>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, today issued the results of an indexing study that reveals neighborhoods in Atlanta and Oklahoma City as those most interested in gourmet and comfort foods, respectively. This data helps advertisers get the most out of their digital ad spend by targeting Thanksgiving diners with ads that speak to their specific tastes in food, whether it be modern, farm-to-table dishes or classic comfort food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint analyzed offline and online data points&mdash;including point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines&mdash;to pinpoint the U.S. cities most interested in gourmet and comfort foods. Not surprisingly, the lists look very different.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities interested in gourmet cuisine are:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Atlanta, GA<br />\r\n2. New York, NY<br />\r\n3. Milwaukee, WI<br />\r\n4. Tampa, FL<br />\r\n5. Charleston, SC<br />\r\n6. Lexington, KY<br />\r\n7. Seattle, WA<br />\r\n8. Portland, OR<br />\r\n9. San Antonio, TX<br />\r\n10. Memphis, TN<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities interested in comfort foods are:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Oklahoma City, OK<br />\r\n2. Green Bay, WI<br />\r\n3. Grand Rapids, MI<br />\r\n4. Kansas City, MO<br />\r\n5. Little Rock, AR<br />\r\n6. Indianapolis, IN<br />\r\n7. Omaha, NE<br />\r\n8. Burlington, VT<br />\r\n9. Paducah, KY<br />\r\n10. Buffalo, NY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe index data further reveals the specific neighborhoods within each city most interested in different food types. In Atlanta, residents of the Poncey-Highland, Old Fourth Ward, Inman Park and Atkins Park neighborhoods are the most likely buyers of gourmet and fresh ingredients, while residents of Oklahoma City&rsquo;s Tribbey, Maysville, Ninnekah and Farwell neighborhoods are most interested in comfort foods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profiles</strong><br />\r\nThe differences between gourmets and &ldquo;comfort foodies&rdquo; go beyond location. These diners also differ in their demographics, interests and purchases:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Those who can&rsquo;t get enough of gourmet foods and ingredients from local supermarkets and restaurants tend to be between 18 and 35 years of age. They also have college educations or advanced degrees, make between $100,000 and $150,000 per year, and love to research the latest cooking trends and consume ingredients that are rare and expensive.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comfort foodies have college educations or advanced degrees too, but they also have children, make between $40,000 and $60,000 per year, cook for their families using common ingredients, and enjoy the basics, such as macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, meatloaf and spaghetti.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the October Interest Index, MaxPoint implemented hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A premium olive oil brand wanted to increase sales of its products within six to eight miles of select retail locations. Using a combination of online display and video ads, MaxPoint targeted gourmets who over-indexed for consumption of premium olive oil within the desired radius. The brand saw a 20% lift in dollar sales in one major metropolitan city and eliminated 46% of waste by targeting the right audience with the right ads.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Competition is fierce among retailers, brands and restaurants, and making the most of digital advertising dollars is a priority for every advertiser this holiday season,&rdquo; commented MaxPoint COO Gretchen Joyce. &ldquo;By taking a hyperlocal digital advertising approach and reaching consumers with ads that speak to their specific tastes in food, marketers can make the most of their Thanksgiving campaigns.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <u><a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a></u>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint Interactive analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

1419	172	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>Influenza is a hot topic right now. Media outlets are abuzz with the latest reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and pharmacies are seeing increased demand for flu shots. Posters touting the benefits of handwashing are dominating schools, workplaces, and public restrooms, and some hospitals are finding themselves at capacity due to increased patient volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of January 5, 47 states were reporting widespread geographic flu activity, and 2 were reporting regional activity.<a href=\\"#_edn1\\" name=\\"_ednref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> &nbsp;A rise in flu cases led Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston to declare a citywide public health emergency in early January.<a href=\\"#_edn2\\" name=\\"_ednref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> Days later, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo followed suit.<a href=\\"#_edn3\\" name=\\"_ednref3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the flu spreads, brands and retailers have seen an uptick in purchases of flu-related remedies&mdash;from facial tissues and chicken soup to antibacterial spray and over-the-counter flu drugs. To help advertisers reach shoppers seeking flu relief, we&rsquo;ve analyzed offline and online data points&mdash;including point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines&mdash;to pinpoint the US cities most interested in the flu right now (i.e., the cities with high saturations of shoppers searching for flu-related topics online and buying related products in stores). By running ads in the top 10 interested cities, advertisers can go beyond the CDC&rsquo;s data, which provides helpful insights at the state level, to focus in on the specific neighborhoods that are putting purchasing power behind the flu this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Cities Interested in the Flu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Huntsville, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Knoxville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Greensboro, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenville, SC</li>\r\n\t<li>Des Moines, IA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Birmingham, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Boise, ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Augusta, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Milwaukee, WI</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nWalk down the aisles of any supermarket or drugstore, and you&rsquo;ll see that shoppers purchasing flu-related items in the top cities tend to share certain characteristics. On average, these shoppers are 36 years old. They also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Make between $50,000 and $60,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Have at least a high school education</li>\r\n\t<li>Have children</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe similarities go well beyond basic demographics, too. A closer examination reveals that those with the flu on their minds search for similar subjects online and make comparable in-store purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inside the Neighborhoods</strong><br />\r\nHyperlocal digital advertising at its core lets an advertiser target the precise neighborhoods interested in a product. The data and insights an advertiser learns about his or her ideal shoppers in a specific neighborhood are then applied across the United States in order to identify other neighborhoods that will also be receptive to that advertiser&rsquo;s ads. This deep, neighborhood-level targeting approach powers successful national campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say, for example, you&rsquo;re an advertiser tasked with promoting a pain reliever marketed under a national brand name. You&rsquo;ve had success in the past selling this particular brand of pain reliever to those suffering from the flu, and you think you can take advantage of the recent rise in flu cases to generate more sales. You could run your ads in many markets by targeting at the DMA level, but chances are you&rsquo;d waste a considerable amount of your ad spend on neighborhoods that haven&rsquo;t seen many flu cases recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maximize your spend, you might instead target your ads to the top cities searching for and buying flu remedies, which would allow you to more efficiently reach shoppers poised to buy your product. And your targeting wouldn&rsquo;t have to stop there. By taking a hyperlocal approach, you could deliver ads that clearly speak to a neighborhood&rsquo;s specific needs and interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take, for example, the top city on our list: Huntsville, Alabama. By layering additional levels of data onto our initial profile of the city, we were able to determine that although neighborhoods in the city generally have an elevated interest in the flu, certain neighborhoods buy generic flu remedies while others opt for brand-name products:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Huntsville Neighborhoods Purchasing Generic Flu Remedies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Darwin Downs</li>\r\n\t<li>Nolan Hills</li>\r\n\t<li>Rainbow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Huntsville Neighborhoods Purchasing Brand-Name Flu Remedies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>West Huntsville</li>\r\n\t<li>Windsor Manor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHow does the data above help you with your ads for a brand-name pain reliever? Now that you know which neighborhoods choose brand-name products, you could choose to run ads in only those neighborhoods. Or, you could run enticing promotions with deeper discounts in an effort to get shoppers in the &ldquo;generic&rdquo; neighborhoods to switch to your brand-name product. In either case, you will drive higher returns by taking a hyperlocal approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nEach year, the flu season starts, peaks, and ends. Flu activity is heightened across nearly every state in the nation right now, making this a great time for advertisers to promote products that appeal to flu-ridden and flu-fearing shoppers. By reaching those with the most interest in the flu, you can get more from your digital ad campaigns this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flu Vaccine </strong>&ndash; A global pharmaceutical company with a diverse health care portfolio&mdash;including pharmaceuticals, eye care products, and vaccines&mdash;wanted to drive adults over 65 years of age to select pharmacy locations to receive flu shots. Using MaxPoint&rsquo;s hyperlocal targeting, the company achieved 164% lift in awareness of its flu vaccine at participating pharmacies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brand-Name Pain Reliever </strong>&ndash; A manufacturer of analgesics wanted to increase brand awareness and drive sales of its products. By running digital ads with MaxPoint, the manufacturer achieved 3% sales lift in mass merchandise stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref1\\" name=\\"_edn1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> CDC, <em>FluView </em>surveillance report, January 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref2\\" name=\\"_edn2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> <a href=\\"http://www.cityofboston.gov\\" target=\\"_blank\\">www.cityofboston.gov</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref3\\" name=\\"_edn3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a> <em>The Huffington Post</em>, January 2, 2013.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Achoo!

The campaign, which celebrates a decade of turning cancer patients into cancer survivors, ran across channels including radio, television, online and out-of-home. Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is a world-class cancer treatment center that unites doctors from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, UW Medicine and Seattle Children&rsquo;s. The results included increased awareness, improved favorability and intent to recommend SCCA to a friend or family member within the Puget Sound region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMixpo partnered with SCCA and MaxPoint to turn 30 second TV spots into interactive online video ads to gather viewers around a difficult subject. Since compelling television ads had already been created, extending into online video was a natural choice for SCCA, rounding out the entire campaign. Mixpo&rsquo;s technology platform made it easy to repurpose existing video assets for cross-screen use. The video ads captured viewers&rsquo; attention with a relatable narrative, a highlight of the campaign. The multiple in-stream video ads created allowed viewers to navigate through and learn more about SCCA&rsquo;s survival rates, watch videos of individual patient survivor stories, connect with SCCA on social networks such as&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://twitter.com/SeattleCCA\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Twitter</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/SeattleCancerCareAlliance\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Facebook</u></a>&nbsp;and YouTube and participate in surveys. Unlike the lean-back approach TV provides, the interactive video ads allowed viewers to become actively involved with the unit and dive deeper into SCCA content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the latest Nielsen Cross-Platform Report, in addition to watching 34-plus hours of TV per week, the average American spends nearly five hours online on the computer. More than half of Americans now watch video online, with online viewing increasing average weekly video consumption to roughly 35 hours, a tremendous opportunity for brands looking to implement cross-screen video advertising strategies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the promotion, SCCA saw a 57% lift in brand awareness from viewers who were exposed to video ads. In addition, a 25% rise in intent to recommend the SCCA, and a 59% increase in favorability of the company were revealed. Interactive video increases consumer awareness &amp; engagement. In this case, it drove 28 times the interaction compared to an average static banner (a 28.49% interaction rate vs. .1% CTR for static banner ads)*. Exposure to Mixpo&rsquo;s video ads was tracked, and surveys were issued to those known to have viewed the ads and those who hadn&rsquo;t. Leveraging MaxPoint&rsquo;s targeting they were also able to hone in on their audience, whereas the other mediums hit a broader range of Puget Sound residents. The difference in responses between the two groups measured the positive lift driven. The SCCA pre-roll video ad campaign drove positive and substantial lift results across all metrics being measured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;TV works, cross-platform works better. In the case of SCCA they already had OOH, TV, radio, print, display ads, etc., but by adding interactive pre-roll ads into the mix, we had the opportunity to increase viewership and brand awareness,&rdquo; said Mixpo CEO Anupam Gupta. &ldquo;SCCA already had powerful TV spots, so it was easy for us to extend the campaign online and make it interactive without complexities traditionally associated with rich media executions.

According to the National Retail Federation, 43% of Americans will dress up this year.<a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> In short, advertisers have many opportunities to drive sales before October 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help retailers and brands this Halloween, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to discover the profiles and top locations for the shoppers most interested in do-it-yourself (DIY) crafts. These crafty consumers create their own costumes and decorations for the Halloween season&mdash;and boost sales for craft retailers and brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Look at Crafty Consumers</strong><br />\r\nWe kicked things off by looking at the group&rsquo;s demographic profile. We found that crafty consumers tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be married</li>\r\n\t<li>Have incomes up to $60,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Have less than a college degree</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Have kids currently living in their households</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNext, we used our proprietary interest data to discover crafty consumers&rsquo; main interests. In addition to crafts, these shoppers frequent sites online about antiques, gardening, and flu remedies. With a strong interest in pets, they also account for some of the 13.8% of Americans who plan to find the perfect costumes for their feline and canine companions this Halloween.<a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A DIY Halloween doesn&rsquo;t stop with crafts&mdash;these shoppers also prefer DIY treats over prepared foods. With this in mind, we looked into the top recipes these shoppers search for online. We found that they frequently cook up comfort foods like butternut squash soup, macaroni and cheese, caramel apples, spaghetti and meatballs, and grilled cheese sandwiches. Additionally, crafty consumers also search for recipes on homemade baked goods, such as pumpkin pie, cupcakes, cake pops, and cookies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we analyzed the group&rsquo;s spending patterns across multiple purchase categories using credit card transaction data. Crafty consumers spend most of their dollars at discount department stores, video and game rental stores, wholesale clubs, automotive retail stores, sporting goods stores, and general merchandise stores like dollar stores. This information can help brands focus their advertising efforts on drawing crafty consumers to the retailers they already know and trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Craftiest Cities</strong><br />\r\nBy combining these four characteristics&mdash;demographics, interests, recipe searches, and credit card transactions&mdash;you can get a good picture of the ideal DIY Halloween shoppers. However, it&rsquo;s not enough to know just who these shoppers are. To really get strong returns, you also have to know where these shoppers live. We ran the numbers and found that the top 10 cities for crafty consumers are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Albany, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Bangor, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Buffalo, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Burlington, VT</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Portland, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Syracuse, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n\t<li>Wilkes-Barre, PA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEach city on this list contains more crafty consumers than the national average. However, not every neighborhood within each city contains crafty consumers. With this in mind, crafts advertisers can drive even stronger returns by targeting only those neighborhoods that care about creating a DIY Halloween.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, within Albany, the crafty consumers cluster in the neighborhoods of Castle-on-Hudson, Feura Bush, and Selkirk. These neighborhoods drive the lion&rsquo;s share of craft purchases for the city, and they should be the focus of any digital advertising push for crafts. However, the neighborhoods of Delmar, Slingerlands, and Westmere have the least amount of crafty consumers within New York&rsquo;s capital and should be avoided when targeting within Albany. This demonstrates the importance of zooming in on neighborhoods, rather than the DMA, to really boost advertising responses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nAdvertisers can use the data above to reach crafty consumers both during the Halloween season and beyond. For example, national retailers that carry craft supplies may increase their national ad buys in neighborhoods within the top 10 cities. Additionally, they can increase the appeal of their ads by incorporating imagery related to crafty consumers&rsquo; interests, such as animals or antiques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Halloween just days away, retailers need to focus their advertising efforts on the right shoppers. When you use the right data to find the right houses, you know you&rsquo;ll get the advertising treats&mdash;and avoid all the tricks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing its Digital Zip technology, MaxPoint has run promotions for retailers looking to boost craft supply sales as well as for brands running Halloween promotions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>North American Arts and Crafts Retailer&mdash;</strong>The largest arts and crafts retailer in North America turned to MaxPoint to drive in-store purchases via weekly sales and specials. We targeted shoppers aged 35&ndash;55, who had children and household incomes below $100,000 per year. Additionally, we limited ad buys to shoppers within a 10-mile radius of store locations. The campaign produced a click-through rate more than twice the industry average.<a href=\\"#_edn1\\" name=\\"_ednref1\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Chocolate Brand at National Dollar Retailer&mdash;</strong>A leading North American chocolate brand approached MaxPoint to help drive awareness of its products at dollar stores for the Halloween season. We targeted shoppers located within six miles of the dollar stores. These shoppers had annual incomes below $40,000 and children in the house. We further narrowed the target audience to those shoppers who purchased from the brand&rsquo;s competition, allowing us to help the candy brand gain market share.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Candy Brand at Global Big Box Retailer&mdash;</strong>A top selling CPG candy brand sought to boost its Halloween candy sales at one of its big box retail partners. We targeted rich media ad buys to mothers aged 35&ndash;44 who had an interest in baking and recipes and who had already purchased candy from the candy brand. We focused on neighborhoods located within driving distance (six to eight miles) of stores. The campaign helped the candy brand reach crowds of qualified shoppers and drive more foot traffic to retail stores that carry the candy. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref1\\" name=\\"_ftn1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a>. <a href=\\"http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1430\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1430</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref2\\" name=\\"_ftn2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a>. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref1\\" name=\\"_edn1\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a> Industry average estimated at .09%.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Crafty Consumers: Shoppers Interested in a DIY Halloween", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/12/11/12_27_54_472_Crafty_Consumers_Shoppers_Interested_in_a_DIY_Halloween_A_MaxPoint_Interest_Index_2013.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Crafty Consumers_Shoppers Interested in a DIY Halloween_A MaxPoint Interest Index_2013.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/10/31/09_25_45_723_CraftyConsumers_Sidebar_Infographic_306x435.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"CraftyConsumers_Sidebar_Infographic_306x435.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTEvMTJfMjdfNTRfNDcyX0NyYWZ0eV9Db25zdW1lcnNfU2hvcHBlcnNfSW50ZXJlc3RlZF9pbl9hX0RJWV9IYWxsb3dlZW5fQV9NYXhQb2ludF9JbnRlcmVzdF9JbmRleF8yMDEzLnBkZiJdXQ/Crafty%20Consumers_Shoppers%20Interested%20in%20a%20DIY%20Halloween_A%20MaxPoint%20Interest%20Index_2013.pdf"	\N	2013-10-29 21:10:44.431244	2013-12-11 18:28:21.593951

547	71	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, NC</strong> <strong>&ndash; November 13, 2012 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;In honor of Black Friday,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>MaxPoint</u></a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, today revealed the results of its Interest Index identifying the 10 U.S. cities most interested in holiday shopping bargains. While Erie, Pennsylvania topped the list, the types of deals residents are interested in differed within each neighborhood. With $586.1 billion in holiday sales up for grabs this year (source: NRF), it&rsquo;s more important than ever for brands and retailers to reach the right shoppers online &mdash; with the right type of deal &mdash; before they head to the store. For this Interest Index, MaxPoint analyzed offline and online data points&mdash;including point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines&mdash;to identify the top 10 cost-conscious cities in the U.S. Shoppers in these cities are most likely to watch their budgets and stick to sale items when checking gifts off their holiday shopping lists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of top bargain-hunting cities in the U.S. includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Erie, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Leesburg, VA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Athens, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenville, SC</li>\r\n\t<li>Lakeland, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Waco, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Pine City, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Richmond, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Hattiesburg, MS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe index data reveals discrepancies between neighborhoods within each city when it comes to the products they are interested in this holiday season. In Erie, residents of the Glenwood, Weber Hills and Eaglehurst neighborhoods are most interested in receiving deals on tech gadgets like tablets and digital cameras, while residents of the Edinboro, Cambridge Springs and North East Township neighborhoods prefer to receive deals on gaming devices like Xbox and PlayStation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nAcross cities, the data from the index found that these bargain hunters had many similar attributes, the most important being their shared interest in long-term savings. These cost-conscious shoppers tend to have children, own their homes, make between $40,000 and $60,000 per year and have a college education. Retailers and brands can reach these &ldquo;savers&rdquo; on Black Friday with targeted digital campaigns promoting coupons, discounts and other bargains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data pulled from the Interest Index, MaxPoint implemented hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns to reach bargain shoppers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For one of the largest and fastest-growing employee-owned supermarket chains in the U.S., MaxPoint created a digital advertising campaign that targeted cost-conscious neighborhoods within a 10-mile radius of select locations. The &ldquo;buy theirs, get ours free&rdquo; campaign offered consumers a free supermarket brand product with the purchase of a national brand&rsquo;s equivalent. The campaign drove traffic to store locations and increased consumers&rsquo; perception of the generic brand&rsquo;s value.</li>\r\n\t<li>For a supermarket chain with more than 200 stores in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, MaxPoint implemented a digital advertising campaign targeting shoppers most interested in holiday bargains. The chain offered savings on gas when its customers purchased $50 in holiday gift cards from their choice of more than 150 retailers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Black Friday and the four-day weekend create a huge opportunity for consumers to do some holiday shopping, but also present a challenge for retailers and brands attempting to break through the clutter,&rdquo; said MaxPoint COO Gretchen Joyce. &ldquo;With our hyperlocal digital advertising solution, we help retailers and brands pinpoint the right customers at the right time to offer deals for a specific type of product or service. This helps advertisers break through the noise and entice consumers to head into the physical store to take advantage of special and highly relevant deals.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

553	74	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Gretchen Joyce, Chief Operating Officer,&nbsp;MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on CMO.COM</em>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>October 12, 2012</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong> Every retail and brand marketer is looking for new ways to generate extra revenue during major shopping seasons, especially during the winter holidays and events like back-to-school. It&rsquo;s natural to assume that such high-traffic events will automatically result in increased sales, but that&rsquo;s not always the case. Take, for instance, an electronics retailer that we recently worked with for its back-to-school campaign. As summer came to an end, the retailer knew it had to kick its marketing into high gear to promote the fact that its stores had the best deals on electronics, especially computers. Like many other brands and retailers, it was competing to be on every parent&rsquo;s back-to-school list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs many CMOs know, there is an inevitable and continuous inventory imbalance during major shopping periods. With the economy in flux, it&rsquo;s hard to predict which consumers are going to be spending their hard-earned money, especially around the holidays. So for the back-to-school shopping season, the retailer used a hyperlocal digital advertising approach to complement its traditional marketing tactics. It was able to target households living within a six- to eight-mile radius of a store location with kids ages 17 to 24 who are going to college for the first time or going back to college.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy targeting specific household types at the neighborhood level, the retailer was able to create demand for inventory in specific locations that needed to move product. As a result, it didn&rsquo;t have to worry about major markdowns and discounts once school started. Now it can apply a similar strategy to the holiday season using the following lessons learned during its successful back-to-school campaign:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t solely rely on national carpet-bombing campaigns:&nbsp;</strong>These massive campaigns are excessive. They might raise broad awareness, but oftentimes your ad dollars are reaching an irrelevant audience&ndash;especially when you just want to reach relevant customers around very specific geographic locations.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be timelier:&nbsp;</strong>Traditional ad campaigns require a lot of preparation. These planned promotions are useful in some instances, but going digital changes the timeline from weeks and months of presale mailings, TV spots, and print ads to being able to launch a hyperlocal campaign in a matter of hours. In addition, you can reuse those traditional assets in a digital, hyperlocal format to maximize and extend the reach of your effort and ad dollars.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Go beyond DMA targeting:&nbsp;</strong>You may be accustomed to targeting a demographic within a DMA, but it&rsquo;s time to get more specific (focused) to move products off of the shelves. To move holiday inventory, you need to know which consumers are interested in those products and close enough to actually shop at that store within a certain mile radius of your stores. It might seem impossible, but by leveraging technology that analyzes billions of offline and online data points, including POS data, you can react to that data analysis and create just-in-time demand that drives sales at the neighborhood level, across the country.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Customize your messaging:&nbsp;</strong>Once you have access to such robust and precise data, you can use national campaign assets that speak to each neighborhood with localized messages, and even include store addresses for locations closest to the customer.

594	94	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Chris Grech, Director of New Media,&nbsp;MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on iMedia Connection.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>April 25, 2012</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been widely reported that digital video advertising budgets will continue to grow at a rapid pace. Forrester Research predicts that U.S. online video ad spend will reach $5.4 billion by 2016 (from $2 billion in 2011). While the number doesn&rsquo;t seem like a tremendous jump, research has found that online video advertising has something that not all media have: a stickiness factor. Nielsen recently found that half of U.S. consumers exposed to a TV ad featuring a sports sedan recalled viewing the advertisement. More importantly, when consumers were exposed to the ad across multiple screens (TV, computer, mobile phone, and tablet), that percentage jumped to 74 percent, a 48 percent increase in ad recall. For a brand or retailer looking to drive in-store traffic, these ads can have quite an effect on brand and product preferences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year is ripe with opportunity for brands and retailers (big and small) to take advantage of digital video advertising campaigns. With major broadcast events like political campaigns, the elections, and the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, traditional broadcast advertising spots will be priced at a premium. This leaves little opportunity for regional and local retailers and brands to get the air time they may be used to. However, millions of consumers will be tuned into online video channels for updates and coverage of these major events &mdash; making digital video advertising an especially lucrative opportunity for retailers and brands of all sizes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether it&rsquo;s a small retailer trying to gain visibility and drive in store traffic in a local market, or a large brand looking to complement a major national campaign with a digital video campaign that gives them additional reach, the medium provides a wealth of opportunities. In addition to brand or message &ldquo;stickiness,&rdquo; video campaigns can be quite effective in helping these retailers drive in-store traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next phase in online video&rsquo;s expansion is in obtaining reach and relevance among the audiences that matter most. This is done by applying &ldquo;big data&rdquo; analysis or knowledge derived from large offline data sets pulled from point-of-sale information, social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines. Brands and retailers armed with this information can more efficiently reach households by executing digital video campaigns, while complementing their traditional offline media plans. This approach makes it far more effective to reach the right consumer at the right time &mdash; especially if you are looking to drive in-store traffic and sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet us use the recent Super Bowl as an example. A major car manufacturer invested roughly $3.5 million to run a 30-second spot introducing a new vehicle to its fleet. The goal of the national campaign was to raise visibility and brand recognition. But now that the ad has run, what happens next? What can that manufacturer do to help drive sales? Should&nbsp;it continue to invest in national spots to continue to drive brand awareness, or would they be better served to complement that with a series of digital video campaigns focused at a key demographic within a certain mile radius of the manufacturer&rsquo;s dealerships? If they want the most promising path to driving traffic, then online video is the way to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDigital video advertising is a great way to reach a relevant audience, which can be identified by assessing billions of data points such as demographics, point-of-sale data, proximity to the car dealership, and annual household income. This is part of the &ldquo;big data&rdquo; I mentioned earlier. Advertisers now have a way to make this data actionable for the benefit of their campaigns. For instance, if the car manufacturer was looking to drive sales of a higher-end luxury car, it&rsquo;s unlikely that&nbsp;it would want to target areas that house a high population of college students. There is no need to re-invent creative either &ndash;&nbsp;it can simply tailor the video used in the national spot, and have it display in targeted areas where the consumers are most likely to purchase the product live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the case of a smaller retailer or restaurant, digital video advertising campaigns not only make advertising more attainable, but they also help to eliminate wasteful advertising spending, which is often a large line item for a small business. Traditional print or broadcast advertising typically offers very little return for local businesses because it&rsquo;s not targeted and eats up a significant amount of budget. For instance, we&rsquo;ve seen a small retailer cut nearly 90 percent of ad spending deemed wasteful by keeping&nbsp;its campaign targeted at only relevant audiences within an eight to 10 mile radius of&nbsp;its store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the exponential growth of online video advertising is telling us anything, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s an ever-evolving and effective medium for retailers and brands of all sizes. Whether your goal is to complement traditional offline and broadcast campaigns or to dedicate the entire budget to online video, this growing medium is fast becoming one of the most cost-effective and influential ways to reach your relevant audience and drive in-store traffic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How to tap video advertising’s potential ", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.imediaconnection.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:07:47.505518	2013-08-27 20:38:29.667104

600	97	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Chris Grech, Director of New Media,&nbsp;MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on ADOTAS. </em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>April 2, 2012</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing popularity of online video has caught the attention of U.S. advertisers, as they realize the incredible reach this medium presents. Just recently, comScore released data from its comScore Video Metrix service showing that 179 million U.S. internet users watched nearly 38 billion online videos in February alone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason for this tremendous growth is three-fold: Publishers have taken advantage of the sharp reduction in shooting and editing costs; viewers have responded by consuming a whopping 200-plus videos per month across thousands of sites; and marketers are fueling the demand by investing in this emerging format thanks to overwhelming evidence that online video is at least as effective as, if not more effective than, broadcast advertising.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the interest around online video has grown, so has the real-time bidding (RTB) market. Both media buyers and publishers are becoming more comfortable with the process, as buyers on the exchange are using more advanced technology to take on more bids at a faster pace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile this is great news for the industry, it is important for buyers to fully understand how they can make the most effective real-time bids for their brand. The reality is that pre-roll video only accounts for 2 percent of all impressions served on the web. Thus, savvy marketers need to treat this small but valuable marketing element carefully to maximize ROI by taking the following points into consideration as they plan their campaigns:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReach the audience that matters most. You&rsquo;ve likely spent a good amount of budget to create your video advertisement, so the worst thing you can do it blast it out to a wasted audience. It is crucial that data is pulled from both on- and offline data sets, such as point of sale information, social media, videos, music, local web pages and online magazines, to find the right audience for your brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember this is a contextual environment. It&rsquo;s important to work with a buyer that has the power to &ldquo;know the page&rdquo; before you buy it. This means understanding the content of the video your ad will be running with. Most brand-conscious marketers do not want their advertisements running during a negative news story, for example, that could tarnish their brand simply by being associated with this type of content.Remember the 80/20 rule. The majority of your sales come from a fraction of your stores, products or services. Marketers are already blanketing their advertisements through broadcast, print and online efforts, so use your online video bids to deliver focused messaging to your most loyal consumers to increase their purchase frequency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile it seems like marketers and media buyers are finally ready to dip their toes into online video RTB, it is important that the same standards that apply to the display world are used for video. Thus, marketers need to compile real, actionable data to create campaigns that not only complement their offline efforts, but reach the right online audience with a message that motivates them to make an offline purchase.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Online Video RTB: What to Know Before You Bid", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.adotas.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:11:37.211565	2013-08-27 20:36:05.709293

One attendee commented, &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t matter what channel my customer comes in through or whether they use multiple channels before ultimately making their purchase.

Rite-Aid customizes its shopper offering through its wellness+ loyalty program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a digital habit for traditionally off-line behavior. Rite-Aid shoppers can earn discounts by watching informational videos. Another program lets shoppers look for coupons by brand, category or value to be loaded to their loyalty card.</li>\r\n\t<li>Advanced planning makes a difference. Manufacturers and vendors need to understand the retailers&rsquo; long-term strategy and help them succeed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Combine content with value. Use videos to communicate content, product and price.</li>\r\n\t<li>Rely on data and adjust strategies. Analysis of data provides new learning that leads to better strategies.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use customers as a source of strategic advantage.

After analyzing billions of offline and online data points, MaxPoint found that Las Vegas has the highest concentration of moms looking for and purchasing back-to-school lunch products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Index data further reveal that there are two distinct types of moms when it comes to preparing lunches for their children: those who enjoy making lunches from scratch and those who prefer quick, easy and convenient meals. In Las Vegas, Nevada, for example, &ldquo;homemade&rdquo; moms dominate the Whitney neighborhood while the Plymouth area outside of South Bend, Indiana, has a high concentration of &ldquo;on-the-go&rdquo; moms. This information is extremely valuable to grocers, food manufacturers and CPG companies that are looking for new ways to reach moms through digital shopper marketing and advertising campaigns. By using a hyperlocal approach, these brands can reach the right audience for their products &ndash; whether they are ingredients for putting together a lunch from scratch or kid-friendly prepackaged lunches.The top 10 cities that show the greatest interest in back-to-school lunches are:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Las Vegas, NV<br />\r\n2. South Bend, IN<br />\r\n3. Greenwood, MS<br />\r\n4. Anchorage, AK<br />\r\n5. Fresno, CA<br />\r\n6. Chicago, IL<br />\r\n7. Houston, TX<br />\r\n8. Twin Falls, ID<br />\r\n9. Yuma, AZ<br />\r\n10. Salt Lake City, UT<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the August Interest Index, MaxPoint implemented hyperlocal digital ad campaigns geared toward specific moms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A regional restaurant chain with a line of farm-fresh food products wanted to drive coupon downloads for its premade products in grocery stores. MaxPoint implemented a highly targeted video ad and coupon campaign geared toward moms with kids under the age of 12 who live within a 6&ndash;8 mile radius of the restaurant chain&rsquo;s locations.</li>\r\n\t<li>A large food production company wanted to drive awareness of its new line of on-the-go meals. MaxPoint created a digital ad strategy targeting moms with kids between the ages of 9 and 17 who previously purchased competitive products within the mini sandwiches category.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;With school starting, moms are looking for new lunch options that fit their families&rsquo; lifestyles. By zeroing in on the neighborhoods that over-index for moms who make homemade versus on-the-go meals, we can help advertisers find the best audience for their products,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint. &ldquo;In order to drive in-store traffic, brands can target moms in different neighborhoods with ads that speak to their specific interests and past purchase behavior.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. For the August Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of online topics related to consumers interested in back-to-school lunches, including quick meals, 30-minute preparations, Rachael Ray recipes and bouillon. In addition, MaxPoint evaluated neighborhoods&rsquo; past purchases of goods related to homemade lunches (cold cuts, celery, apples, sandwich bags, etc.) and on-the-go products (premade lunches, fruit cups, single-serve snacks, etc.).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint </strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands. The company&rsquo;s Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology delivers the most effective and scalable neighborhood-level online campaigns. MaxPoint can pinpoint qualified customers interested in purchasing a product with more precision than using traditional zip codes, ultimately offering accurate neighborhood-level targeting with national reach and local results.

With these statistics in mind, it&rsquo;s important for brick-and-mortar businesses&mdash;and the brands that sell within them&mdash;to connect with consumers to drive them into stores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the last six decades, newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, direct mail and free standing inserts were the primary channels for reaching and serving ads to a target audience. More recently, advertisers have recognized the importance of digital advertising and have been putting more of their local advertising dollars online. According to a report by media research company BIA/Kelsey, the rate of digital ad growth outstrips total local media expenditures and is expected to rise 2.6 percent annually through 2016 to $151.3 billion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what do advertisers and brands need to consider when allocating local advertising budgets online?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It&rsquo;s the scale and reach, cost-effectiveness, speed and flexibility of digital that enables advertisers to efficiently drive in-store traffic. Digital intrinsically offers greater flexibility for a campaign, and localized digital advertising solutions allow advertisers to target different ads to different neighborhoods around the country.</li>\r\n\t<li>Not every consumer lives within close proximity of a retail store. National retailers waste a lot of national ad spend on consumers who live outside a store&rsquo;s retail trade area. This waste gets only more pronounced as retailers get more local. With localized advertising solutions, only consumers who match a retailer&rsquo;s shopper profile and who live within a specific radius of a retail location will see your ad.</li>\r\n\t<li>Although most advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to generate interest in their product or services (for example, during a certain time of year or around a special event), highly localized digital campaigns of any size can launch within a matter of hours because you can leverage existing creative assets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOnce advertisers have found ways to properly target digital ads on a neighborhood level, they should see a lift in product sales and engagement with the brand at a specific retail location and/or a lift in traffic for retailers at specific locations.For more on giving digital campaigns a local edge, click&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://streetfightmag.com/2012/04/26/giving-national-campaigns-a-local-edge/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Localizing Advertising Budgets", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.imediaconnection.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 03:03:18.863076	2013-08-27 20:25:14.459562

MaxPoint discovered that although the demographics of the neighborhoods were identical (consumers ages 25-34 with a household income of $60,000-80,000), there are two very distinct neighborhood types when it comes to barbequing &mdash; those that prefer chicken and those that prefer pork. This information is invaluable to advertisers looking to effectively reach consumers with the right message, in the right place at the right time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from this index, MaxPoint implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital ad campaigns for a variety of retailers and brands:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major chicken brand wanted to drive awareness of its chicken breast patties in 18 different markets. MaxPoint helped the company drive in-store traffic by targeting women ages 25-54, who have children ages 7-17, and who have purchased competitive chicken brands.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A national pork brand needed to generate brand awareness and drive sales of its pork products at targeted store locations. As a result of a focused digital advertising campaign, the company was able to drive in-store sales by targeting consumers ages 35-64 who live within an 8-mile radius of each store location and who are interested in competitive brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;The results of this Interest Index were unexpected to say the least. Not only were we surprised to find the biggest barbeque food fans in the Pacific Northwest, but the data showing their strong preferences toward particular meats is both interesting and incredibly valuable to advertisers looking to market specific products,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer of MaxPoint. &ldquo;This data shows that to reach the right consumers, advertisers need to go beyond traditional DMA targeting and understand the preferences, interests, lifestyle, purchasing habits, demographics and locations &ndash; right down to the neighborhood level &ndash; of prospective customers to increase brand awareness and drive in-store sales.&rdquo;About the<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.&nbsp;For the July Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics related to consumers interested in and purchasing barbeque foods such as meats and sauces, as well as related recipes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands.

It starts by getting local. Hyperlocal, that is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the biggest concerns for brands and retailers is the idea of having to liquidate seasonal events and holidays that typically spur excess sales. In an ideal world, stores have enough of a product during the high-traffic times and an appropriately adjusted amount of inventory left in the months to follow. The supply side knows the &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; model well, but it is imperative that stores understand how to create just-in-time demand as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvaluating local digital advertising strategies will help determine the best way to drive foot traffic to nearby stores. It is an incredibly effective way to create just-in-time demand for specific products at the first signs of inventory imbalance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraditional advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months&nbsp;in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive traffic to stores. Digital changes all that. Now, brands can &mdash; and should &mdash; reuse campaign assets to launch hyper-local digital campaigns in a matter of hours. This gives marketers incredible power &mdash; no longer do campaigns need to be planned far in advance. Now, marketers can supplement planned promotions with those that drive demand at the&nbsp;individual store level, based on the inventory at any given location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile targeting consumers within a certain demographic in a specific DMA is common practice, retailers should be targeting consumers with specific interests within a certain mile radius from stores with excess inventory, to take that targeting technique to a far more advanced level. This requires leveraging technology that analyzes both online and offline data points and making&nbsp;this data actionable in a matter of milliseconds. This data is incredibly valuable, revealing the attributes of neighborhoods across the country so brands and retailers can drill down to target only those neighborhoods with residents that are a fit for their products and services, driving real traffic to specific stores, with the ability to scale nationwide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce neighborhood data is determined, national campaign assets can be easily customized with&nbsp;localized messages and the address of the nearest store location. Not only does this create a more&nbsp;personalized ad experience, it creates consistency across all ad elements on various media, and&nbsp;contributes to the ROI on the money spent on campaign creative. This is key for brands looking to&nbsp;maximize their ad investments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, a national craft store chain wanted to drive awareness of its back-to-school products to consumers within a 10-mile radius of specific store locations. By using demographic, point-of-sale and geographic data, the chain was able to target consumers on a hyperlocal level. It hit either a.) only female teachers, ages 25-55, with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, and a household income of less than $60,000; or b.) mothers, ages 35-55, with a household income of less than $100,000, and frequent purchasers of craft products based on past data.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHyperlocal precision takes incentives and offers to a whole new level. If in-store sales are slow for a&nbsp;particular item, brands and retailers can create campaigns that incentivize local consumers to come in and make purchases of that specific item.Those companies that solely run carpet-bombing national campaigns need to rethink their digital ad&nbsp;strategy. If building awareness is the goal, this strategy works. But if you want to move products off&nbsp;shelves, carpet-bombing can be irrelevant, too broad and just plain expensive. Instead, they should&nbsp;complement national campaigns with hyperlocal campaigns. Get local, and you will move seasonal items off-the-shelf, where and when you want.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How Hyper-Local Can Play in Holiday Marketing", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://digiday.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 02:50:45.549929	2013-08-27 20:08:13.882922

After analyzing billions of offline and online data points, MaxPoint found that neighborhoods in the Washington, DC, area have the highest concentration of people interested in athletics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Index data further revealed that there are two unique personas when it comes to staying active: those who enjoy watching and supporting organized sports teams, and those who enjoy working on their own physical fitness. The Potomac Hills neighborhood in McLean, Virginia, indexed highest for its interest in sports teams, while the Garfield Heights neighborhood in the District of Columbia prefers to focus on personal exercise routines. This information is extremely valuable to advertisers who offer products or services that appeal to either sports fans or exercise enthusiasts but not necessarily both groups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities that show the greatest interest in athletics are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n\t<li>Binghamton, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Santa Barbara, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Gainesville, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Philadelphia, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Honolulu, HI</li>\r\n\t<li>Madison, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the September Interest Index, MaxPoint implemented hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns geared toward sports fans and fitness enthusiasts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A CPG manufacturer of a new line of energy-enhancing cereal wanted to reach men who had both an interest in sports and an active lifestyle.

613	103	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By: Joe McKendrick<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on Database Trends and Applications.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>March 7,&nbsp; 2012</strong> <strong>&ndash;&nbsp;</strong>For enterprises grappling with the onslaught of big data, a new platform has emerged from the open source world that promises to provide a cost-effective way to store and process petabytes and petabytes worth of information. Hadoop, an Apache project, is already being eagerly embraced by data managers and technologists as a way to manage and analyze mountains of data streaming in from websites and devices. Running data such as weblogs through traditional platforms such as data warehouses or standard analytical toolsets often cannot be cost-justified, as these solutions tend to have high overhead costs. However, organizations are beginning to recognize that such information ultimately can be of tremendous value to the business. Hadoop packages up such data and makes it digestible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor this reason, Hadoop &ldquo;has become a sought-after commodity in the enterprise space over the past year,&rdquo; Anjul Bhambhri, vice president of Big Data Products at IBM, tells DBTA. &ldquo;It is cost-effective, and it allows businesses to conduct analysis of larger data sets and on more information types than ever before, unlocking key information and insight.&rdquo; Hadoop couldn&rsquo;t have arrived on the scene at a better time, since it is estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are now being created every day, she adds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe advantage that Hadoop provides is that it enables enterprises to store and analyze large data sets with virtually no size limits. &ldquo;We often talk about users needing to throw data on the floor because they cannot store it,&rdquo; says Alan Gates, co-founder of HortonWorks and an original member of the engineering team that took the Pig subproject (an analysis tool run on Hadoop) from a Yahoo! Labs research project to an Apache open source project. &ldquo;Hadoop addresses this, and does more,&rdquo; he tells DBTA. &ldquo;By supporting the storage and processing of unstructured and semi-structured data, it allows users to derive value from data that they would not otherwise be able to. This fundamentally changes the data platform market. What was waste to be thrown out before is now a resource to be mined.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHadoop is an open source software framework originally created by Doug Cutting, an engineer with Yahoo! at the time, and named after his son&rsquo;s toy elephant. The Hadoop framework includes the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which stores files across clustered storage nodes and is designed to scale to tens of petabytes of storage. Prominent Hadoop users include social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo!, and Amazon. Facebook&rsquo;s Hadoop cluster is estimated to be the largest in the industry, with reportedly more than 30 petabytes of storage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it&rsquo;s no longer just the social media giants that are interested in Hadoop, as their leaders point out. Data managers within big data companies are growing just as enthusiastic about the potential that Hadoop offers to get big data under control, says Peter Skomoroch, principal data scientist at LinkedIn. Hadoop &ldquo;is a disruptive force, hitting the mainstream and being adopted by the big players in the Fortune 100,&rdquo; he tells DBTA. &ldquo;A year ago, Apache Hadoop needed to mature as a platform, particularly in security, and further define enterprise adoption outside of the consumer web space. Today, Hadoop has hit the milestone of a 1.0 release and the community has put a significant amount of thought and effort into security, with government organizations and large established companies making Hadoop a key part of their data strategies.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ecosystems</strong><br />\r\nHadoop also includes a robust tools ecosystem, which includes the MapReduce engine, originally designed by Google, which supports functions called Job Tracker and Task Tracker that seek to run applications in the same node or as close to data sources as possible, thereby reducing latency. Additional tools include ZooKeeper, a configuration and coordination service; Sqoop (SQL-to-Hadoop), a data import tool;&nbsp; Hive, a Hadoop-centric data warehouse infrastructure; Pig, an analysis platform for data from parallelized applications; Oozie, a workflow service; Hue, a graphical user interface for Hadoop; and Chukwa, a monitoring tool for large Hadoop-enabled systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Applications</strong><br />\r\nWhile there is a lot of hype and excitement around Hadoop, David Gorbet, vice president of product strategy at MarkLogic Corp., urges companies to step back and evaluate their big data needs. &ldquo;At its core, Hadoop was born out of a need for a parallel compute framework for large-scale batch processing,&rdquo; he tells DBTA. &ldquo;Hadoop is exciting because it presents a new option for solving computationally expensive problems on commodity hardware. By breaking the problem up and farming pieces of it out to be executed in parallel by &lsquo;map&rsquo; functions, and then rolling up the result in a &lsquo;reduce&rsquo; function, it allows faster processing of data to enable complex tasks like finding, formatting or enriching unstructured data.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most compelling value propositions for Hadoop-in combination with MapReduce-is the ability to apply analytics against large sets of data.&nbsp; From this perspective, &ldquo;the current primary value of Hadoop is low cost storage for large volumes of data, along with support for parallel processing,&rdquo; Mark Troester, data management and IT strategist with SAS, tells DBTA.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor my company, Hadoop means we can analyze extremely large sets of data at a very localized level to help us buy the best impressions for our customers&rsquo; digital advertising campaigns,&rdquo; says Kurt Carlson, CTO of MaxPoint.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA popular application for Hadoop has been the ability to turn around large data processing jobs in a very short time. &ldquo;We have seen broad adoption of Hadoop by users looking to shrink the time to run a batch job from weeks to hours,&rdquo; says Max Schireson, president of 10gen. &ldquo;By giving engineers a flexible batch processing framework on which to program their batch processing jobs, Hadoop has gained enormous traction very quickly.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndustry observers also point out that we are only at the beginning stages of the innovations Hadoop will bring to data management operations. &ldquo;We identified predictive analytics, visualization, and packages atop Hadoop Core to address a larger scope of problems,&rdquo; Murali Raghavan, senior vice president and head of Horizontal Services at iGATE Patni, tells DBTA. &ldquo;The next phase around data cleanup will be the real-time analysis and decision-making, and we&rsquo;re looking at using those technologies to help our clients make more informed decisions based off their data.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next stage for Hadoop will be &ldquo;for processing analytic use cases directly in Hadoop,&rdquo; says Troester. &ldquo;However, before analysis applications can fully leverage Hadoop, those solutions need to be able to identify the relative data. Ideally, this would be done using a visual exploratory capability that is aware of the organizational context. The organizational context consideration is especially important, since data streams in. If an organization can identify information that is relevant and timely based on organizational knowledge built into email, wikis, product categories and other sources, it can better determine what data to analyze and process. The data that is not relevant at that point in time can be placed on cheap, commodity-based storage for later use.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Enterprise Infancy</strong><br />\r\nWhile the technology holds great promise for enterprises, Hadoop is not without its challenges, especially to early adopters of the technology. First and foremost is, simply, the fact that the solution is still relatively new, especially when brought into the realm of enterprise applications. &ldquo;Hadoop is in its enterprise infancy,&rdquo; Ramon Chen, vice president of product management for RainStor points out. &ldquo;Lack of security and a single node point of failure are just a few shortcomings, which are actively being addressed by the open source community. The great thing about Hadoop is that you can simply add nodes as you need to scale. While this seems manageable due to the low purchase costs, the hidden economic downside is the substantial ongoing administration and operating costs of a significant number of nodes.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis calls for knowledge and skills that many enterprises don&rsquo;t have under their roofs yet. &ldquo;Hadoop&rsquo;s complexity and the current lack of skills to support it are two of the problems,&rdquo; IBM&rsquo;s Bhambhri cautions. The good news, she adds, is that &ldquo;these challenges can be addressed with training options that are currently available.&rdquo; Leading vendors now offer Hadoop training to IT professionals. For its part, IBM now offers a Hadoop Fundamentals course, and &ldquo;BigDataUniversity.com offers hundreds of tutorials, videos and exercises on the basics of Hadoop and other topics such as stream computing, open source software development, and database management techniques,&rdquo; Bhambhri adds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Hadoop is a highly powerful big data framework but it is not user-friendly,&rdquo; agrees Yves de Montcheuil, vice president of marketing at Talend. &ldquo;Developers need to develop highly specialized skills to write MapReduce programs. And it is certainly not usable by business analysts.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with a dearth of skills, there are additional limitations, as pointed out by Troester. &ldquo;These include the fact that building and maintaining a Hadoop cluster is complicated and expensive,&rdquo; he tells DBTA. &ldquo;Better tools are needed; the Hadoop core structure is fluid; file systems vary; and Hadoop was originally designed for off-line batch processing.&nbsp; Most of these limitations need to be addressed by the open source and vendor community focused on basic Hadoop distribution.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHadoop &ldquo;is meant to complement existing data technology, not replace it,&rdquo; L.N. Balaji, president of ITC Infotech (USA), points out. &ldquo;It works best for read-intensive processing as opposed to data that requires frequent updates. But it is essentially batch-oriented. Once it starts processing a data set, it can&rsquo;t easily be updated. Thus, it is not appropriate for real-time uses.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Gates points out that Hadoop&rsquo;s batch-oriented processing &ldquo;is not a flaw; it is a design choice. Hadoop was designed to handle very large volumes of data and processing that can be broken into many parallel units. This means it performs very well for algorithms that need to scan vast amounts of data-such as fraud detection or web user session analysis-and for situations where data can be stored in a large distributed hash, such as Facebook using it to store the messages for its mail. These same design choices make Hadoop a poor choice for algorithms that require transactions or locks across different data sources-for example, a shopping cart application where the user&rsquo;s shopping cart and the store&rsquo;s inventory need to be updated in one transaction. These OLTP problems are much better handled by RDBMSs.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGates agrees, however, that &ldquo;Hadoop falls short on usability,&rdquo; noting that the framework needs to integrate well with existing monitoring and management tools so that data center administrators can use the tools they already have. In addition, data movement is not yet adequately addressed, he adds. &ldquo;Getting data into and out of Hadoop is often still a manual process or depends on very young, immature tools. Vendors are starting to address this, but their products are early in their lifecycle.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome industry observers also question how efficiently Hadoop can manage big data. &ldquo;Due to the discrete nature of this big data, Hadoop is exceptional at simple structuring, aggregation and transformation,&rdquo; Robert Greene, vice president of technology at Versant, points out. &ldquo;However, Hadoop is not good at the other side of the story-creating the links that lead to big complex data &ndash; though many are trying to force-fit Hadoop into this role,&rdquo; he tells DBTA. &ldquo;This is intuitively obvious as linking removes the property of being discrete. Data that is no longer discrete is not easily processed as a parallel operation by using the same architectural brute force for transformation and aggregation.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConversely, enterprises need to adopt data management capabilities that are Hadoop-aware. These capabilities include &ldquo;basic data integration, data quality and governance,&rdquo; says Troester. &ldquo;These capabilities should provide native capability for leveraging the power of Hadoop-pushing down the appropriate processing into Hadoop and leveraging parallelization. Hadoop also needs the best possible analytics. SAS analytics, storage, and parallel processing capabilities perfectly complement Hadoop. In practice, this means allowing SAS functionality to be executed as MapReduce code. In addition, support for Hadoop Pig, Hive, and MapReduce is needed directly within the data management tools.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Sample No More</strong><br />\r\nCurrently, most early enterprise implementations attempt to fit Hadoop into the current constrained analytical tools that can only handle samples of the data, says Gates. Ultimately, the power of Hadoop is to enable analytics across an entire data set. see many users doing large data crunching in Hadoop and then extracting slices of data into an RDBMS or OLAP system for doing reporting or ad hoc queries,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Hadoop is not yet full-featured enough to support these functions in a way users are accustomed to. But this limits the power of Hadoop. Now instead of reporting on all of the data, users are reporting on aggregated subsets, or on samples. In time, reporting and analytics tools need to evolve to use Hadoop&rsquo;s parallelism so they can access all of the data, instead of a slice.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Versant&rsquo;s Greene offers that this capability opens up new challenges, as well. &ldquo;The relational database does successive queries and applies the set operators to find data matches re-establishing the links, pipelining a set operation for each subsequent query into the results of the current query,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;In Hadoop, the same basic processes occur, except it is not something that gets automated by the engine. Instead, the subsequent level of query in Hadoop, a query being a MapReduce operation resulting in a map, must get &lsquo;joined&rsquo; with the current MapReduce operation&rsquo;s resulting map, by the developer writing some custom code to do the set operation.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile this workaround provides querying capabilities in Hadoop, &ldquo;it is both highly inefficient and unmanageable in both development and production within a complex system,&rdquo; Greene continues. &ldquo;Ultimately, trying to force Hadoop into this paradigm to solve the linking problem carries the same computational costs found in a classic relational database solution. Even worse, there are no indexes to speed things up. It just gets us right back where we were at the start with scalability and performance problems when dealing with big complex data.&rdquo; NoSQL databases need to be employed in conjunction with Hadoop to help resolve these issues, he adds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProponents are quick to point out that Hadoop will only get stronger and more robust as enterprises adopt the technology to its fullest potential, and the skills base expands. Ultimately, &ldquo;widespread adoption and a stable platform means developers can extend existing libraries, instead of everyone reinventing the wheel,&rdquo; Skomoroch points out. &ldquo;The future will be in the programming languages and applications built on top of Hadoop. We&rsquo;ll see a number of specialized applications emerge within verticals like finance, biotech, marketing, and retail that take advantage of this new platform. In the 1980s the PC changed the way we live and work. The current workplace has been revolutionized by the growth of the internet and mobile devices. The next major shift will be around big data, and Hadoop is at the foundation of that revolution. Storage gets cheaper every day, and if you have more data you can make better decisions than competitors. In 5 years, everyone will be an analyst.&rdquo;</p>\r\n", "title"=>"HADOOP Enters the Enterprise Mainstream, and Big Data Will Never Be the Same", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.dbta.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:18:56.938274	2013-08-27 20:07:18.888418

782	137	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>The gaming industry offers significant opportunity for the creative agencies and in-house advertisers that promote its products. In 2012 alone, retail sales of gaming hardware, software, and accessories totaled $13.26 billion.<sup>1</sup> As the industry continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important for advertisers to know where to find gamers and what motivates them to buy. With this in mind and amidst the backdrop of the 2013 Game Developers Conference&mdash;the world&rsquo;s largest professionals-only industry event&mdash;MaxPoint took a closer look at two especially important types of gamers: the early adopters and the so-called latecomers. These two distinct types of consumers have specific buying preferences, demographics, and online search behavior that distinguish them from the general gaming audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Gamers: An Overview</strong><br />\r\nBefore focusing on early adopters and latecomers specifically, it&rsquo;s important to get a feel for the general gaming audience. At the latest count, 40% of all gamers are female.<sup>2</sup> Adult gamers are also seasoned players; on average, an adult gamer has played computer and video games for 12 years.<sup>3</sup><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGamers also share similar online search behavior and purchase histories. Among their online search topics, you&rsquo;ll find Assassin&rsquo;s Creed, Halo, Minecraft, PlayStation, World of Warcraft, and Xbox. In their shopping baskets, you&rsquo;ll find game controllers, gaming consoles, personal computers, tablets, and of course, video games from retailers such as Best Buy, RadioShack, and h.h. gregg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn advertiser tasked with promoting a gaming product can use this general knowledge about gamers to lay the foundation for his next digital ad campaign. Gamers&rsquo; demographics, online search behavior, and purchase histories can be especially useful as the advertiser develops compelling ad creative and determines where to place his ads. However, he should be cautious. Advertising based solely on the general profile of a gamer (although a common starting point), doesn&rsquo;t fully take into account the nuances of the gaming industry. Gaming&rsquo;s digital advertisers can achieve greater success by targeting specific types of gamers. This leads us to the early adopters and the latecomers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Early Adopters</strong><br />\r\nEarly adopters are just what they sound like: gamers who use the newest technologies. They purchase the latest gaming equipment and stay informed about current gaming trends. In neighborhoods with a high concentration of early adopters, shoppers also tend to be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Single</li>\r\n\t<li>Homeowners</li>\r\n\t<li>Those with bachelor&rsquo;s or master&rsquo;s degrees</li>\r\n\t<li>Those who make $60,000+ per year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA quick search of early adopters&rsquo; online search histories reveals the &ldquo;general&rdquo; gaming keywords noted above in addition to keywords that indicate a heightened interest in new and developing technologies, such as 3D printing, Apple iWatch, Google Glass, Lytro camera, and iPhone 5S. And it&rsquo;s not just who these early adopters are but also where they live. Our research shows that neighborhoods with a high concentration of early adopters can be found in the following cities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Fairbanks, AK</li>\r\n\t<li>Fort Smith, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>Hartford, CT</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Louisville, KY</li>\r\n\t<li>Milwaukee, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Parkersburg, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Philadelphia, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>Rapid City, SD</li>\r\n\t<li>Rockford, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Terre Haute, IN</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nGaming&rsquo;s early adopters are those most likely to sign up for pre-release email updates, to be members of beta test groups, to pre-order the newest games, to consistently consume industry news sites, and to stand in line for the most in-demand technologies and games. In these ways, early adopters are markedly different from gaming&rsquo;s latecomers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Latecomers</strong><br />\r\nUnlike early adopters, latecomers prefer time-tested technologies over the latest and greatest gaming hardware and software. They limit their purchases to proven equipment and casually stay informed about new industry developments. In neighborhoods with a high concentration of latecomers, shoppers tend to be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Married</li>\r\n\t<li>Homeowners</li>\r\n\t<li>Those with less than a college education</li>\r\n\t<li>Those who make less than $60,000 per year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNeighborhoods with a high concentration of latecomers can be found in the following cities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bangor, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Birmingham, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Charleston, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Clarksburg, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Fargo, ND</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenville, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Johnstown, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Knoxville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Lubbock, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK</li>\r\n\t<li>Quincy, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Sacramento, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Savannah, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Spokane, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Tri-Cities, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Wichita Falls, TX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nHyperlocal digital advertising gives advertisers the ability to reach gamers with specific interests and purchase behaviors that are most compatible with the products the advertisers are selling. In addition to precise targeting, it maximizes an advertiser&rsquo;s return on investment; by reaching only those neighborhoods with his ideal shoppers, an advertiser eliminates ad waste and ensures that his message is put in front of the right people in the right neighborhoods across the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Ubisoft launches Assassin&rsquo;s Creed IV: Black Flag next year, it will get the most out of its digital advertising if it takes a hyperlocal approach. Why? Because as our research shows, there are clear types of gamers: those who will rush out to get the new game (the early adopters) and those who will instead opt for an older version, such as Assassin&rsquo;s Creed III (the latecomers). An ad that encourages shoppers in &ldquo;early adopter&rdquo; neighborhoods to pick up Assassin&rsquo;s Creed IV: Black Flag from their local gaming stores will likely be successful; if run in &ldquo;latecomer&rdquo; neighborhoods, however, the same ad may fall flat. Instead, an ad that offers a discount on Assassin&rsquo;s Creed III or another time-tested version may resonate with and generate higher response rates in &ldquo;latecomer&rdquo; neighborhoods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the distinction between early adopters and latecomers is any indication, the gaming industry&rsquo;s consumers are considerably different. Within its ranks are gamers with specific interests and buying patterns who live in certain neighborhoods (and not others) across the country. As such, advertisers can ensure that they get the most out of their budgets by consistently taking a hyperlocal approach to their digital advertising efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we executed a digital advertising campaign on behalf of a media rental company, targeting latecomers likely to rent video games in neighborhoods near its retail locations. The ads offered a promotional coupon for a free rental and resulted in a response rate nearly four times the industry average. MaxPoint also leverages its knowledge about gamers in campaigns for portable gaming consoles, video games, and accessories, including vibrating controllers and headsets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

530	60	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>In 2011, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported that the average retail cost of menu items for a classic, home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner (with turkey, stuffing, cranberries, pumpkin pie, and standard trimmings for 10 guests) was $49.20. For busy families that had little time to cook their own dinners, ready-to-eat Thanksgiving meals from supermarkets and takeout restaurants averaged $50 to $75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition is fierce among retailers, brands, and restaurants looking to capture a greater piece of the Thanksgiving pie this season. One way advertisers can get the most out of their digital ad spend is by targeting Thanksgiving diners with ads that speak to the audience&rsquo;s specific tastes in food, whether it&rsquo;s modern dishes or classic comfort food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help give advertisers a leg up against the competition this season, we analyzed offline and online data points&mdash;including point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines&mdash;to pinpoint the US cities most interested in gourmet and comfort foods. Not surprisingly, the lists look very different:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Top 10 Cities Interested in Gourmet Foods</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Atlanta, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Milwaukee, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Tampa, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Charleston, SC</li>\r\n\t<li>Lexington, KY</li>\r\n\t<li>Seattle, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Portland, OR</li>\r\n\t<li>San Antonio, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Memphis, TN</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Top 10 Cities Interested in Comfort Foods</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Grand Rapids, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Kansas City, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Little Rock, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>Indianapolis, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Omaha, NE</li>\r\n\t<li>Burlington, VT</li>\r\n\t<li>Paducah, KY</li>\r\n\t<li>Buffalo, NY<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shopper Profiles</strong><br />\r\nThe differences between gourmets and &ldquo;comfort foodies&rdquo; go beyond location. These diners also differ in their demographics, interests, and purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who can&rsquo;t get enough of gourmet foods from local supermarkets and restaurants tend to be between 18 and 35 years of age. They also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have college educations or advanced degrees</li>\r\n\t<li>Make between $100,000 and $150,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Love to research the latest cooking trends and consume ingredients that are rare and expensive</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nComfort foodies have college educations or advanced degrees too, but they also:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have children</li>\r\n\t<li>Make between $40,000 and $60,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Enjoy the basics, such as macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, meatloaf, and spaghetti</li>\r\n\t<li>Cook for their families using common ingredients</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFrom their online searches to their everyday purchases, these two groups are strikingly different. Check out the infographic at the end of this report to learn more about these shoppers, including what they&rsquo;re searching for online and which products they&rsquo;re purchasing in stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inside the Neighborhoods</strong><br />\r\nKnowing that Atlanta, Georgia, tops the list of cities with gourmets is a great advantage to restaurants, brands, and retailers. Take a national restaurant chain that&rsquo;s running a promotion for a complete, hassle-free Thanksgiving meal. The chain may use the lists of cities interested in gourmet and comfort foods to develop targeted ads that resonate with each city. Although a promotion for old-fashioned mashed potatoes may not hit home with an Atlanta audience, an ad that highlights the restaurant&rsquo;s twist on a traditional item&mdash;perhaps macaroni and cheese with white truffle oil, fontina cheese, and panko bread crumbs&mdash;may be highly successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to target Thanksgiving diners with the right ads extends beyond the city level, too. Advertisers who adopt a hyperlocal digital advertising approach can drill down even further to the specific neighborhoods that have the most interest in either gourmet foods or comfort foods. Take a look:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta Neighborhoods Most Interested in Gourmet Foods</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Poncey-Highland</li>\r\n\t<li>Old Fourth Ward</li>\r\n\t<li>Inman Park</li>\r\n\t<li>Atkins Park</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOklahoma City Neighborhoods Most Interested in Comfort Foods</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Tribbey</li>\r\n\t<li>Maysville</li>\r\n\t<li>Ninnekah</li>\r\n\t<li>Farwell</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nMaking the most of digital advertising dollars is a priority for every advertiser this holiday season. By taking a hyperlocal digital advertising approach and reaching consumers with ads that speak to their specific tastes in food, advertisers can make the most of their Thanksgiving campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>California Olive Ranch</strong> &ndash; The premium olive oil brand wanted to increase sales of its products within six to eight miles of select retail locations. Using a combination of online display and video ads, MaxPoint targeted gourmets who over-indexed for consumption of premium olive oil within the desired radius. The brand saw a 20% lift in dollar sales in one major metropolitan city and eliminated 46% of waste by targeting the right audience with the right ads.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Thanksgiving Cook-Off: Gourmets Meet Comfort Foodies", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/09/03/11_07_22_649_Thanksgiving_Cookoff_Gourmets_Meet_Comfort_Foodies_A_MaxPoint_Interactive_Interest_Index_2012.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Thanksgiving Cookoff_Gourmets Meet Comfort Foodies_A MaxPoint Interactive Interest Index_2012.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "header_image_uid"=>NULL, "header_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/06/08_29_35_539_thanksgiving_cookoff.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"thanksgiving-cookoff.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMDMvMTFfMDdfMjJfNjQ5X1RoYW5rc2dpdmluZ19Db29rb2ZmX0dvdXJtZXRzX01lZXRfQ29tZm9ydF9Gb29kaWVzX0FfTWF4UG9pbnRfSW50ZXJhY3RpdmVfSW50ZXJlc3RfSW5kZXhfMjAxMi5wZGYiXV0/Thanksgiving%20Cookoff_Gourmets%20Meet%20Comfort%20Foodies_A%20MaxPoint%20Interactive%20Interest%20Index_2012.pdf"	\N	2013-05-14 22:17:30.618008	2013-09-21 01:11:56.854993

After analyzing billions of offline and online data points, MaxPoint found that Las Vegas has the highest concentration of moms looking for and purchasing back-to-school lunch products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Index data further reveal that there are two distinct types of moms when it comes to preparing lunches for their children: those who enjoy making lunches from scratch and those who prefer quick, easy and convenient meals. In Las Vegas, Nevada, for example, &ldquo;homemade&rdquo; moms dominate the Whitney neighborhood while the Plymouth area outside of South Bend, Indiana, has a high concentration of &ldquo;on-the-go&rdquo; moms. This information is extremely valuable to grocers, food manufacturers and CPG companies that are looking for new ways to reach moms through digital shopper marketing and advertising campaigns. By using a hyperlocal approach, these brands can reach the right audience for their products &ndash; whether they are ingredients for putting together a lunch from scratch or kid-friendly prepackaged lunches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The top 10 cities that show the greatest interest in back-to-school lunches are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Las Vegas, NV</li>\r\n\t<li>South Bend, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenwood, MS</li>\r\n\t<li>Anchorage, AK</li>\r\n\t<li>Fresno, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Chicago, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Houston, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Twin Falls, ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Yuma, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the August Interest Index, MaxPoint implemented hyperlocal digital ad campaigns geared toward specific moms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A regional restaurant chain with a line of farm-fresh food products wanted to drive coupon downloads for its premade products in grocery stores. MaxPoint implemented a highly targeted video ad and coupon campaign geared toward moms with kids under the age of 12 who live within a 6&ndash;8 mile radius of the restaurant chain&rsquo;s locations.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A large food production company wanted to drive awareness of its new line of on-the-go meals. MaxPoint created a digital ad strategy targeting moms with kids between the ages of 9 and 17 who previously purchased competitive products within the mini sandwiches category.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;With school starting, moms are looking for new lunch options that fit their families&rsquo; lifestyles. By zeroing in on the neighborhoods that over-index for moms who make homemade versus on-the-go meals, we can help advertisers find the best audience for their products,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;In order to drive in-store traffic, brands can target moms in different neighborhoods with ads that speak to their specific interests and past purchase behavior.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interactive Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint Interactive analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. For the August Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of online topics related to consumers interested in back-to-school lunches, including quick meals, 30-minute preparations, Rachael Ray recipes and bouillon. In addition, MaxPoint evaluated neighborhoods&rsquo; past purchases of goods related to homemade lunches (cold cuts, celery, apples, sandwich bags, etc.) and on-the-go products (premade lunches, fruit cups, single-serve snacks, etc.).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint </strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint Interactive&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands. The company&rsquo;s Digital Zip<sup>&reg; </sup>technology delivers the most effective and scalable neighborhood-level online campaigns. MaxPoint can pinpoint qualified customers interested in purchasing a product with more precision than using traditional zip codes, ultimately offering accurate neighborhood-level targeting with national reach and local results.

According to the National Retail Federation, spending for holiday d&eacute;cor this year alone will reach $6.9 billion. And of the $749.51 the average holiday shopper will spend in 2012, $100.76 will be spent on food and candy, $28.66 on greeting cards, and $51.99 on decorations, including inflatable snowmen and festive lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2011, MaxPoint Interactive released the results of its first study ranking the US cities with the most holiday cheer. At the time, we analyzed billions of offline and online data points to score cities on a variety of holiday interests, including holiday recipes, holiday decorating, classic holiday movies, and the perfect Christmas gifts. This year, we repeated that study to see which cities have moved to the top of the list and which have lost a little bit of that holiday magic. Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Top 10 Cities with Holiday Cheer (2012)</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n\t<li>Eau Claire, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Portland, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Omaha, NE</li>\r\n\t<li>Evansville, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Traverse City, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Buffalo, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Boise, ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Wilmington, NC</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSixth on last year&rsquo;s list, Salt Lake City has truly embraced holiday cheer this season, moving up in the rankings to displace Eau Claire, Wisconsin, which slips to #2. Familiar cities on the list also include Green Bay, which once again comes in at #8. In addition to the old standbys, this year&rsquo;s top 10 sees plenty of newcomers including Portland, Omaha, Evansville, Traverse City, Buffalo, Boise, and Wilmington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nWondering which shoppers have the most holiday cheer? Our research revealed that consumers with holiday spirit:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are 55 years of age or older</li>\r\n\t<li>Are married</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a household income of $100,000+</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCheck out the infographic at the end of this report to learn more about these shoppers, including what they&rsquo;re searching for online and which festive holiday products they&rsquo;re purchasing in stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inside the Neighborhoods</strong><br />\r\nAdvertisers who are looking to capitalize on shoppers&rsquo; feelings of holiday cheer this season can get the most out of their budgets by taking a hyperlocal approach to digital advertising. By considering neighborhood-level interests, purchase data, demographics, and more, they can locate the specific neighborhoods that have the most holiday spirit. Take Salt Lake City for example. Within this top-ranking city, there are pockets of shoppers who have even more holiday cheer than their fellow city residents. You can find the cheeriest holiday shoppers in the following neighborhoods:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Carriage Chase</li>\r\n\t<li>Hidden Valley</li>\r\n\t<li>River Oaks<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nHoliday advertising is in full gear, and shoppers everywhere are stocking up on holiday decorations, investigating new recipes, researching last-minute gift guides, and purchasing the final items on their lists. Nearly every retailer, brand, and restaurant can learn something from the list of cities with the most holiday spirit. A retailer selling baking supplies can target consumers who have expressed interest in holiday cookies with a digital campaign that drives those consumers to their nearest store location. Similarly, a brand that manufactures toys can target consumers interested in the most popular holiday gifts for toddlers using detailed demographic and interest data, rather than blanketing an entire DMA with seasonal ads that may not apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Santa Diapers</strong> &ndash; We used targeted digital advertising to locate mothers of young children living in neighborhoods near select retail locations. The campaign, which aimed to generate awareness and increase in-store sales of holiday-themed diapers, resulted in a strong CTR that exceeded the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holiday Baking</strong> &ndash; Using our hyperlocal digital advertising technology, we pinpointed the neighborhoods that have the most interest in holiday baking and that have also over-indexed for purchases of baking supplies. We ran a digital advertising campaign targeting shoppers in these neighborhoods. A third party verified that the campaign led to an increase in brand awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holiday Celebrations</strong> &ndash; For a well-known juice brand, MaxPoint implemented a digital advertising campaign promoting a seasonal, alcohol-free alternative to wine and champagne. The campaign resulted in a strong CTR that exceeded the industry average.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"All Wrapped Up in Holiday Cheer", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/09/03/11_11_03_241_All_Wrapped_Up_in_Holiday_Cheer_A_MaxPoint_Interactive_Interest_Index_2012.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"All Wrapped Up in Holiday Cheer_A MaxPoint Interactive Interest Index_2012.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "header_image_uid"=>NULL, "header_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/06/08_31_45_573_holiday_cheer.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"holiday-cheer.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMDMvMTFfMTFfMDNfMjQxX0FsbF9XcmFwcGVkX1VwX2luX0hvbGlkYXlfQ2hlZXJfQV9NYXhQb2ludF9JbnRlcmFjdGl2ZV9JbnRlcmVzdF9JbmRleF8yMDEyLnBkZiJdXQ/All%20Wrapped%20Up%20in%20Holiday%20Cheer_A%20MaxPoint%20Interactive%20Interest%20Index_2012.pdf"	\N	2013-05-14 21:46:12.621285	2013-12-04 23:05:31.429367

With the start of a new year and most fitness-focused resolutions still unbroken, MaxPoint conducted the research to provide advertisers seeking to sell health-related products with the neighborhoods most likely to respond to them. This research comes on the heels of the company&rsquo;s December Interest Index on the cities with the most &ldquo;Holiday Spirit.&rdquo; The cities that indexed the highest when it comes to people looking to make a change for a healthier lifestyle in 2012 are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Johnstown, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Burlington, VT</li>\r\n\t<li>Fresno, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Gainesville, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Marquette, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Panama City, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Wheeling, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Wausau, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Charlotte, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Billings, MT</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from this index data, MaxPoint implemented highly-targeted neighborhood- level digital campaigns for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>An athletics shoe retailer, who was able to identify and target neighborhoods that indexed highest around interests in jogging or running<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A high-end organic yogurt brand&rsquo;s introduction into neighborhoods that indexed high for healthy eating and fitness<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A large retailer, who used this information to drive participation for free health screenings and information on quitting smoking<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A national retail chain, who announced the redesign of its produce section to carry more fresh fruits and vegetables to the neighborhoods that would be most receptive to this information</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Too often, retailers and brands are wasting spend on advertising that is very broadly focused or not relevant to the audience they are reaching,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;By leveraging digital solutions that are very targeted at key demographics, retailers and brands can execute more effective and efficient advertising campaigns. This Interest Index is just one of many examples how MaxPoint can get the critical and highly-accurate information advertisers need to reach a specific audience to drive in-store traffic.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<u><a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a></u>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint Interactive analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. The company then scores each neighborhood across hundreds of topics related to healthier lifestyles including fitness, health, nutrition, body image, weight loss tips and healthier eating, which cluster together indicating broader interest trends over a period of time. The January Interest Index focused on neighborhoods that demonstrated the biggest spike in interest of healthier lifestyles from December 2011 to January 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands.

State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leslie Rand-Pickett, a career counselor at N.C. State, said companies from the Triangle area, as well as nationally-recognized companies, are recruiting more students from N.C. State compared with previous years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Companies from the West Coast also recruit from N.C. State, such as Microsoft, Google and Intel, even though they aren&rsquo;t located in the Triangle,&rdquo; Rand-Pickett said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rand-Pickett also said companies such as IBM, Cisco and SAS have locations in the Triangle area and have historically recruited from N.C. State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Rand-Pickett, after the engineering career fair earlier this semester the N.C. State interview suite exceeded capacity during almost the entire month of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Overall, I would say that it&rsquo;s not a new concept for high-profile tech companies to come to N.C. State,&rdquo; Rand-Pickett said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a tradition because of the high quality of the technical students our university produces.&rdquo; However, more companies from the Triangle area are beginning to participate in career and job fairs at N.C. State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MaxPoint, a digital advertising company, recently began recruiting N.C. State students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewey Tran, director of business analytics at MaxPoint, said his department hires consistently from the graduates of N.C. State&rsquo;s Master of Science in Analytics program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the recent programs that has provided a lot of strong value for local employers is the Master of Science in Analytics program,&rdquo; Tran said. &ldquo;What N.C. State is doing a very good job of is staying on top of the current trends in terms of the market.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tran said the program is relatively new and is one of the first advanced-degree programs in data analytics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an example of a program where they&rsquo;ve combined the aspects of data and business and the benefits of the program are very far reaching,&rdquo; Tran said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Tran, programs such as the Master of Science in Analytics at N.C. State have conditioned students to find suitable job opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to recruit people that have academic talents and be able to deal with technical problems, and what N.C. State provides is smart folks that can complete their tasks because they are well-rounded,&rdquo; Tran said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Rappa, founder and executive director of N.C. State&rsquo;s Institute for Advanced Analytics, said that training in the field can bring about a rewarding and lucrative career.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute for Advanced Analytics, founded in 2007, is preparing a new generation of data-savvy professionals for leadership in a digital world. In 2012, graduates of the Institute had a job placement rate of more than 90 percent by graduation for the fifth year in a row giving the program an esteemed reputation across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The degree, a M.S. in Analytics, is a 10-month program designed to teach students how to master extrapolating large amounts of data and make relevant, insightful conclusions from vast amounts of information. While originally enrolling 40 students in its first year, it now hosts 80 students, and applications for the program continue to rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A critical component of the program is the practicum, which is analogous to a capstone project in other degree programs. The practicum is a team-based learning experience giving students the opportunity to conduct real-world analytics projects using data from sponsoring organizations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students work in teams of four-to-five members to understand some type of business problem, and they then work to clean and analyze the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practicum spans a length of seven months, culminating in a report and presentation to their respective sponsors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teams perform their work under a confidentiality agreement, and the results remain the sole property of the sponsor. Current sponsors include a wide variety of sources including private companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Proctor &amp; Gamble, GE Energy, as well as governmental agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the United States Postal Service, and the Central Intelligence Agency. Even the Houston Astros, a Major League Baseball team, is a sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software companies such as Red Hat, whose Raleigh location was previously located on Centennial Campus, have recruited an increasing number of students from N.C. State after expanding to larger buildings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Red Hat currently has more than 5,900 employees worldwide, with more than 900 in downtown Raleigh at the Red Hat Tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim Jokisch, the director of employment branding and media at Red Hat, said that the company is always looking at the talent coming out of N.C. State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have had a long history for recruiting from N.C. State for internships and recent graduate students. We have always enjoyed a good relationship with N.C. State,&rdquo; Jokisch said.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Recruiting of N.C.

650	118	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>July 2012 &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>To increase sales of its Huggies Snug &amp; Dry diapers at Sam&rsquo;s Club earlier this year, Kimberly-Clark wanted to hone in on a highly specific audience within a very limited geographical radius &ndash; moms aged 18-34, with children aged 0-2, living within a couple of miles of a Sam&rsquo;s Club. The consumer packaged goods maker also wanted to reach Sam&rsquo;s online-centric audience through display advertising, but without blanketing the Web with ads served up to those uninterested in diapers or not located near a Sam&rsquo;s warehouse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe solution was highly targeted, data-driven digital advertising, a fairly new option that is vastly expanding and moving the needle for brand marketers. A host of data analytics companies, media publishers, online advertising networks and agencies have jumped on board the hyperlocal bandwagon in the hopes of snagging a piece of the lucrative national brand spend pie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven just a couple of years ago, Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s current goal of using targeted digital ads down to the neighborhood level, combined with an understanding of shopper segments and purchase behavior, at the large scale necessary would have been an impossibly tall order. &ldquo;We want to eliminate waste in delivering impressions,&rdquo; says Richard Moulton, marketing director for Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club teams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about getting more segmented and targeted &ndash; serving up ads at the right time, in the right place, to the right audience.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe targeted digital advertising industry, still in its early stages, has become a highly confusing and fragmented landscape of complex technologies and a tough-to-track value chain. Nevertheless, CPGs have begun to test the targeted waters, shifting some spend to companies combining online and offline data with highly sophisticated analytics technologies &ndash; promising digital ad targeting at the ZIP code level (and beyond) that can also be tied to in-store sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>IP Addresses, Cookies and Beyond</strong><br />\r\nThanks to improved targeting and back-end measurement, overall online advertising spend has been on the rise and will cruise past print budgets for the first time this year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. U.S. online ad spending grew 23% to $32.03 billion in 2011, and it is predicted to grow to $39.5 billion in 2012, which would put it above total U.S. magazine and newspaper spending, according to eMarketer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut while so-called digital geo-targeting &ndash; serving up online ads to those in a specific geographical radius &ndash; has been around since the mid-2000s through the use of IP address data (the numerical label assigned to a computer on a network), its success was limited in terms of precision. For example, IP addresses for most AOL users came from a Virginia server, even though AOL users lived around the country, so ads served up to AOL subscribers may or may not have been geographically appropriate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd even as proximity targeting became more accurate, usually through the use of Internet &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; (a piece of data stored in a computer&rsquo;s browser that can be used as identification and/or proof of where the user is online), it was still no easy task to determine whether these Web surfers were the right audience in terms of lifestyle segment or purchase behavior &ndash; that of young moms with infants and toddlers, for example.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Neighborhood-Level Targeting</strong><br />\r\nToday&rsquo;s hyperlocal offerings use highly sophisticated analytics to layer and combine different types of data with the latest digital technology to serve up ads to an audience of pinpointed prospects in specific neighborhoods &ndash; often on a very large scale of millions of impressions. Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s work in January with Morrisville, N.C.-based hyperlocal data analytics company&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a> on the Huggies/Sam&rsquo;s Club challenge is an example of this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutionsmaxpointinteractive.com/solution\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint&rsquo;s solution</a>&nbsp;cross-references IP addresses with point-of-sale data provided by retailers, and then uses proprietary analytics technology to determine which U.S. neighborhoods over-index for a certain behavior or lifestyle, such as young moms. It uses the results to determine ad network media buys, which then serve up appropriate display ads to the right target audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically the concept of &lsquo;birds of a feather flock together,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Gretchen Joyce, MaxPoint&rsquo;s chief operating officer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hitting one person or one house, but all of the folks in a neighborhood within the right radius of a store where the client is trying to drive sales. That&rsquo;s what gets the volume you need to not just bring in one appropriate customer into a store, but hundreds and thousands.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHistorically, Joyce points out, CPGs have spent most of their marketing dollars leveraging print, direct mail, in-store promotions and out-of-home marketing. That is changing, however, as granular digital advertising options can help CPGs get just as targeted as direct mail, but online advertising allows for more flexibility and real-time shifts in algorithms or creative.Connecting Offline to OnlineOne of MaxPoint&rsquo;s competitors in the targeted digital advertising space, Westminster, Colo.-based Datalogix, refers to these types of hyperlocal campaigns as &ldquo;digital direct marketing.&rdquo; However, the firm, which has a strong heritage in offline direct marketing, determines its target audience differently than MaxPoint.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Rob Holland, Datalogix&rsquo;s general manager in charge of the consumer products vertical, the company works with the CPG or retail client to determine what audience it is looking to reach. Then, it does a study of those category buyers and creates an online audience by analyzing in-store purchase data and using the Datalogix proprietary database of more than 110 million households.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have the ability to match offline data to online data,&rdquo; says Holland. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a CPG selling a packaged food product and I want to reach people who buy my product, shop in my category or have other types of product affinities such as skewing toward organic. We can build that audience by matching offline CRM files to online cookie information &ndash; we&rsquo;ve made the investment to create significant relationships across the Web where we can match millions of cookies and connect our offline databases to our online audiences.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome consider the use of cookies to be a privacy red flag in terms of gathering personally identifiable information, but Holland insists Datalogix&rsquo;s cookie use is anonymous. MaxPoint, however, makes a point of noting its lack of cookie use in hyperlocal targeting, as does another competitor in the neighborhood-level ad targeting space, a Chicago-area agency and unit of IPG Mediabrands called Geomentum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLisa Bradner, a former Forrester Research analyst and now general manager at Geomentum and its sister company, Shopper Sciences, says the company uses its own proprietary research on shopper segments and behavior and combines it with ZIP code-level geographic data as well as, in some cases, point-of-sale or loyalty data provided by the client to determine the right display ad audience. She does admit that Geomentum sometimes does media buys with partner companies who use cookies, and that cookie use, the retention of the cookie data and other issues typically depend on the client&rsquo;s needs, policies and decision-making.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Duking It Out for the Right Data</strong><br />\r\nMore data, Bradner points out, shouldn&rsquo;t always be the goal when it comes to hyperlocal targeting. Getting down to the single household level, she explains, may not provide the necessary scale for the client or meet its campaign needs. &ldquo;Too much data can actually be a trap for the marketer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about winning the shopper at the neighborhood level.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a longtime player in the digital advertising game such as publisher Yahoo, Sunnyvale, Calif., the secret sauce is in a name and address data file of more than 150 million U.S. consumers, or nearly half of the U.S. population. &ldquo;Addressability&rdquo; is the unique key to its geographic targeted offerings, according to Jeff Minich, product marketer, audience targeting, at Yahoo, who says the company provides geo-targeted advertising solutions to clients that combine Yahoo&rsquo;s name and address data with frequent shopper data and measurement courtesy of data partners such as Nielsen Catalina, Cincinnati; Experian, Costa Mesa, Calif.; and Acxiom, Little Rock, Ark.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rely on user registration data to determine what proximity-based segments a user falls into for targeting &ndash; so we target based on actual home address vs. a log-in location,&rdquo; says Minich. After all, he explains, users may log in at home, at work, or while traveling, but they tend to do their shopping within 15 miles of home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYahoo also avoids &ldquo;cookie churn,&rdquo; or the rate at which cookies are cleared or deleted from a person&rsquo;s computer with its method, says Minich. &ldquo;It enables us to serve ads to a consistent audience over time.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Learning Curve</strong><br />\r\nWith vendors of all shapes and sizes vying for a share of brand spend in hyperlocal digital advertising, it&rsquo;s unclear what kind of solution will take the lead and what type of targeting &ndash; from cookies and IP-level targeting to offline point-of-sale or ZIP code algorithms &ndash; will prevail in this fragmented universe.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDigital advertising is like a jump ball right now,&rdquo; says Bradner. &ldquo;No one knows who&rsquo;s going to grab it.&rdquo; The only certainty, she adds, is that &ldquo;the shopper is at the center of everything &ndash; and you have to find that shopper.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the landscape still in an era of experimentation, Datalogix&rsquo;s Holland says the industry remains in the early phases of the learning curve &ndash; and CPG brand marketers are struggling to meet the challenge and keep up with the pace of change. &ldquo;This space has really grown up beneath the CPGs and retail advertisers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of learning going on.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough its work with MaxPoint, Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Moulton is one of the marketers studying the learning curve, and while he may not fully understand the analytical depths of how MaxPoint&rsquo;s solution works, he is basing his judgment on the campaign&rsquo;s results. Those results are promising thus far, but he points out that the jury is still out &ndash; and that hyperlocal, targeted digital advertising remains only a small part of the company&rsquo;s mix of marketing channels.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re seeing click-through rates above industry norms, but we&rsquo;re not yet completely satisfied,&rdquo; Moulton says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased with the program&rsquo;s results, and I appreciate its flexibility and ability to shift in real time, but we still want to raise the bar higher.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>CPG marketers are increasingly turning to digital advertising campaigns that target potential shoppers based on their location, even at the neighborhood level.</li>\r\n\t<li>Targeted digital advertising, still in its early stages, has become a confusing and fragmented landscape of complex technologies and a tough-to-track value chain.</li>\r\n\t<li>Kimberly-Clark has targeted young moms living within a couple of miles of Sam&rsquo;s Club locations with ads for Huggies Snug &amp; Dry diapers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Online ad spending is predicted to surpass magazine/newspaper spending this year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Solution providers such as MaxPoint Interactive, Datalogix, Geomentum and Yahoo help CPGs target online consumers using IP addresses and cookies as well as POS and other data from various data partners.</li>\r\n\t<li>One exec says digital advertising is a jump ball right now.

While spending continues to climb, nearly three in four respondents have made changes to their grocery shopping habits within the last year, becoming more cost-conscious before and during their trips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the ways cost-conscious grocery shoppers in the U.S. have changed their behavior include the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Shopping Closer to Home and Shopping Multiple Grocery Stores<br />\r\nMore than 40 percent of moms and those age 25-54 indicate that in the past year they have started shopping multiple grocery stores to get the best prices and deals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Leveraging Coupons and Sales More<br />\r\nClose to half of all respondents and 50.4 percent of Moms said they clip coupons and scan their loyalty cards regularly for savings. On average, 26 percent of respondents use some form of digital coupons. Moms are most likely to use digital coupons, with nearly a third using digital methods to find coupons. Three in four respondents said they are more likely to try a new product at the grocery store if they have a coupon for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Preparing Lists Before Shopping<br />\r\nSixty-two percent of respondents regularly make lists before going grocery shopping and more than half make their list using general product categories, rather than specific brands. Three in five decide which brand to purchase while they are in the store based on price, coupons and special promotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Using More Resources Such as Digital Channels to Prepare for Shopping Trips<br />\r\nMore than 90 percent of shoppers regularly research products online before purchasing them in-store. Moms and those age 25-54 are more likely than adults 18 and over to use the Internet to prepare for grocery shopping trips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Heading to Recipe-Specific Destination Sites to Prepare for Shopping<br />\r\nMoms are also the most likely group of respondents to use digital methods to find recipes when preparing for a trip to the grocery store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Due to the economy, consumers are shifting their shopping behaviors to get more for their money,&rdquo; said Dianne Kremer, senior analyst at BIGinsight. &ldquo;As consumers feel a pinch from rising gas and food prices, they are becoming more creative with how they spend their grocery budgets &ndash; shopping closer to home, going to multiple stores to get the best deals and looking online for coupons and offers.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther key findings:<br />\r\n- Average monthly&nbsp;spend on groceries has steadily increased&nbsp;among the general population from pre- to post-recession from $250.94 in August 2007 to $277 in August 2011. Among moms, it has steadily increased from $311.95 to $341.14 during the same timeframe.<br />\r\n- Two in five respondents indicate they are&nbsp;purchasing more store brand or generic items&nbsp;now than compared with this time last year; 53.4 percent are purchasing the same amount.<br />\r\n- Three in 10 respondents have&nbsp;cut back on purchasing&nbsp;bakery&nbsp;items, candy, dessert items and magazines/books/DVDs over the past year. One in four have cut back on prime cuts of meat and seafood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Digital is reshaping the grocery shopping experience in the post-recession economy, as consumers turn to new channels to help plan their shopping trips,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, MaxPoint COO. &ldquo;By understanding what motivates today&rsquo;s consumer, brands can tailor their shopper marketing strategies to ensure they are gaining mindshare and winning at the shelf-level.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;retail advertising platform helps to drive in-store traffic for retailers and brands.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How Today’s Cost-Conscious Grocery Shoppers Tick", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>""	\N	2013-05-15 03:52:12.739589	2013-08-27 18:40:59.429402

648	117	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>June 28, 2012</strong> &ndash; <a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, today announced the results of its June Interest Index. By analyzing billions of data points, MaxPoint is able to determine the U.S. neighborhoods most interested in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games &ndash; valuable data for brand advertisers with related products and services. The results of this Interest Index found that Madison, Wisconsin &ndash; specifically neighborhoods within its Middleton suburb &ndash; have the highest interest in the Olympics of all neighborhoods in the U.S.<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities with neighborhoods that showed the greatest interest in the Olympics include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Madison, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Lansing, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Knoxville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Peoria-Bloomington, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Des Moines, IA</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, NY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint analyzed data consumed by neighborhoods throughout the U.S., such as offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. The company then scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics, which cluster together indicating broader interest trends over a period of time. MaxPoint used a composite score that consisted of a variety of Olympic interests including &ldquo;Team USA 2012,&rdquo; &ldquo;Michael Phelps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Olympic gymnastics,&rdquo; among a number of other specific athletes, events and related terms to compile the top 10 list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith billions of dollars in advertising spend expected around the Olympic Games this year, the results of this Interest Index go beyond the capabilities of traditional DMA targeting to reveal those U.S. neighborhoods that are most receptive to Olympic-themed campaigns. This data is invaluable for brands and retailers looking to avoid the wasted ad dollars associated with blanketed campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to MaxPoint&rsquo;s research, the neighborhoods with the most Olympic spirit tend to have higher income and are well educated compared with the rest of the nation. Residents of the highest ranking cities typically had an average income of $80,000 per year and college educations.Using the data from this index, MaxPoint implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital advertising campaigns for both brands and retailers. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major skincare brand was looking to drive in-store sales by increasing coupon downloads of its product using an Olympic athlete as its spokesperson in their creative. Using MaxPoint&rsquo;s Digital Zip technology, the brand was able to drive participation by targeting neighborhoods with women aged 25-54, with a household income of $50k or higher, an active sports lifestyle and an interest in skin care.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A marquee consumer packaged goods company was interested in increasing coupon downloads for its newest cereal brand. As a result of a highly targeted online video campaign featuring famous athletes, the CPG manufacturer was able to increase sales in all four of its markets by reaching neighborhoods showing a high interest in sports.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;The Olympic Games capture the attention of consumers across the globe, and here in the U.S. we spend a lot of time and money supporting our athletes,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer of MaxPoint. &ldquo;This index proves that even with events of national interest, there are specific neighborhoods across the country that are more attractive advertising targets than others based on their location, demographics, interests and lifestyle. This is the type of information that is crucial to retailers and brands looking to target specific consumer segments with special deals or products.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

By analyzing billions of in-store purchases and online data points, MaxPoint identified two distinct groups and where they live: green thumbs, who are interested in cultivating their own gardens and seeking out information on the topic, and brown thumbs, who don&rsquo;t tend their own gardens and show very little interest in learning how to garden. Brown thumbs are very interested in curb appeal; they just don&rsquo;t want to do it themselves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the 2012 National Gardening Survey by the National Garden Association, the DIY gardening market totaled $29.1 billion in 2011. The survey also reported that home improvement centers and mass merchants claim about 51% of the market share, increasing their dominance over garden nurseries and hardware stores. To help garden supply companies better reach consumers, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip technology to analyze information about the neighborhoods most interested in gardening in the United States. This allowed the hyperlocal advertising company to create a profile of both green thumbs and brown thumbs, including their demographics, interests and neighborhood locations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint found that green thumbs tend to be 55 and older with an income of $20,000&ndash;$60,000 per year, own their own home, have children and have likely not completed college. They trend high on interest in things like eco-friendly products and home improvement, and they tend to consume a lot of information on law and the government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrown thumbs are typically between the ages of 18 and 44, have an income that exceeds $80,000 per year, often own their own homes and most likely have a college degree. Brown thumbs are also interested in extreme sports, fashion and heart health. They tend to research allergy relief products, which may also explain their lack of interest in DIY gardening.Green thumbs and brown thumbs sometimes live in the same cities. But interestingly, they often live in different neighborhoods within these cities. Digital Zips, or neighborhoods, with heavy concentrations of both green thumbs and brown thumbs are located in the following cities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ft.

Advertisers must have insights into which neighborhoods within these cities specifically trend high for green thumbs vs. brown thumbs in order to find the right shoppers in the right neighborhoods&mdash;otherwise they are wasting valuable ad dollars,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint. &ldquo;We help advertisers cut through the DMA clutter to deliver hyperlocal ad campaigns that drive in-store results.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the Index, MaxPoint executed a digital advertising campaign on behalf of a lawn care services company. The campaign targeted brown thumbs near the company&rsquo;s various locations, offering customers a free quote online or a free onsite evaluation. The target profile for this campaign was homeowners between the ages of 25 and 54 who have household incomes of $75,000 or more a year and who demonstrate an interest in curb appeal. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was 1.5 times the industry average.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local web pages and online magazines.

537	64	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C.</strong> <strong>&ndash; March 21, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;As the gaming industry gears up for the annual&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.gdconf.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Game Developers Conference</u></a>&nbsp;in San Francisco,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>MaxPoint</u></a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;technology, has identified U.S. cities with the neighborhoods most interested in gaming. By analyzing billions of in-store purchases and online data points, MaxPoint identified two distinct groups of gamers: early adopters, or those looking for the latest gaming technology, and latecomers, or gamers who prefer time-tested technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the NPD Group, retail sales of gaming hardware, software and accessories totaled $13.26 billion in 2012. As the industry continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly important for advertisers to know where to find gamers and what motivates them to buy. MaxPoint&rsquo;s proprietary interest data indicates that these groups approach gaming-related products from different perspectives and have different needs in the purchase cycle.MaxPoint found that early adopters tend to be college-educated, single homeowners with an average income of more than $60,000 per year. They purchase the latest gaming equipment and stay informed about the newest gaming trends. According to the Index, neighborhoods with a high concentration of early adopters can be found in the following cities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Fairbanks, AK</li>\r\n\t<li>Fort Smith, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>Hartford, CT</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Louisville, KY</li>\r\n\t<li>Milwaukee, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Parkersburg, WV</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Philadelphia, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>Rapid City, SD</li>\r\n\t<li>Rockford, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Terre Haute, IN</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLatecomers, on the other hand,&nbsp;are often married homeowners without a college degree. Making less than $60,000 per year, these consumers limit gaming purchases to proven equipment and casually stay informed about gaming developments. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of latecomers can be found in the following cities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bangor, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Birmingham, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Charleston, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Clarksburg, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Fargo, ND</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenville, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Johnstown, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Knoxville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Lubbock, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK</li>\r\n\t<li>Quincy, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Sacramento, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Savannah, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Spokane, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Tri-Cities, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Wichita Falls, TX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Advertisers charged with promoting game-related products tend to rely on general knowledge about gamers as the foundation for their campaigns. But, as we learned when examining our interest data, the gaming industry&rsquo;s consumers are distinctly different. Advertising solely on general profiles doesn&rsquo;t take into account the specific needs, interests and buying behaviors of various types of gamers, such as early adopters and latecomers,&rdquo; said MaxPoint COO Gretchen Joyce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, when Ubisoft launches&nbsp;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed IV: Black Flagnext year, it will get the most out of its digital advertising if it tailors its approach to specific gamers. An ad that encourages shoppers in &ldquo;early adopter&rdquo; neighborhoods to pick up&nbsp;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed IV: Black Flagfrom&nbsp;their local gaming stores will be successful; that same ad may fall flat, however, in &ldquo;latecomer&rdquo; neighborhoods. Instead, an ad that offers a discount on&nbsp;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed III&nbsp;or another time-tested version may resonate with and generate higher response rates in &ldquo;latecomer&rdquo; neighborhoods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the Index, MaxPoint executed a digital advertising campaign on behalf of a media rental company, targeting latecomers likely to rent video games in neighborhoods near its retail locations. The ads offered a promotional coupon for a free rental and resulted in a response rate nearly four times the industry average.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint also leverages its knowledge about gamers in campaigns for portable gaming consoles, video games and accessories, including vibrating controllers and headsets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

539	67	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C.</strong> <strong>&ndash; February 5, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Just in time for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>MaxPoint</u></a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, released the results of its monthly Interest Index, this time identifying the most fashionable neighborhoods in New York City. As the largest fashion retail market in the U.S., generating more than $15 billion in sales each year, NYC contains some of the most fashion-conscious neighborhoods in the country (source: New York City Economic Development Corporation,&nbsp;Fashion.NYC.2020.2012).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy analyzing billions of online data points, MaxPoint was able to drill down to find the neighborhoods most appropriate for fashion-related hyperlocal advertising campaigns. With that, the top stylish NYC neighborhoods (in alphabetical order) are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Astoria</li>\r\n\t<li>Central Park South</li>\r\n\t<li>Chelsea</li>\r\n\t<li>Gramercy-Flatiron</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenwich Village</li>\r\n\t<li>Sunnyside</li>\r\n\t<li>West SoHo</li>\r\n\t<li>White Plains</li>\r\n\t<li>Williamsburg</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEach of these neighborhoods indexed high for online activity surrounding fashion, such as searching for New York Fashion Week and luxury designers and goods, while also consuming online fashion magazine websites and blogs. With more than 100,000 fashion industry insiders, including buyers, editors, retailers and celebrities, attending Fashion Week in NYC this week, advertisers can use this valuable data to break through the clutter and reach the right shoppers with highly targeted digital campaigns that inspire in-store purchases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nThese fashionable shoppers, both men and women, tend to be between 35 and 44 years old and single. Surprisingly, these shoppers tend to have household incomes between $40,000 and $80,000, showing that many of their searches are aspirational, an invaluable insight for luxury and mid-market retailers alike. In addition to fashion, these shoppers also demonstrate an elevated interest in interior design, arts and culture, gourmet food, yoga, beauty, weddings and running.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, MaxPoint ran several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A national high-end department store chain entering a new market wanted to drive awareness of its products and services among fashion-conscious women 25&ndash;44 years old with household incomes over $50,000. By targeting neighborhoods within a 20-mile radius of store locations with targeted advertising campaigns, MaxPoint was able to double engagement rates and triple overall display click-through rates (CTRs) for the department store.</li>\r\n\t<li>A luxury fashion designer looking to increase visits to its website and drive in-store purchases enlisted MaxPoint to identify stylish neighborhoods within 8&ndash;10 miles of its retail locations with household incomes of more than $100,000. By targeting these neighborhoods with hyperlocal campaigns, the designer was able to eliminate wasted advertising spend and increase its overall CTR while gaining valuable analytics about its customers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;New York Fashion Week draws global attention every year and is not only a crucial time for designers, but also retailer and brand advertisers,&rdquo; said MaxPoint COO Gretchen Joyce. &ldquo;Although New York City may be one of the fashion capitals of the world, it is important for advertisers to realize that not every neighborhood is created equal when it comes to interest and buying power in fashion. This sort of data is invaluable when advertising budget is at stake. By taking a hyperlocal approach, retailers can drive foot traffic to specific store locations and garner real results from their campaigns.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a> technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

Many planners have taken the proven path of looking closely at how each of their client&rsquo;s channels performed during the past year before selecting the right combination for the year ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when you consider that there has only been a gradual uptick in consumer spending, combined with a constant shift in how Americans consume media, the only thing certain about 2013 is a lot of uncertainty. So, how can media planners prepare their clients for a successful year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems counterintuitive to look back instead of ahead for new strategies that address both shifting media behaviors and an uncertain economy. Traditional media is becoming less effective, especially as consumers turn to social and mobile channels &mdash; including laptops, tablets, and smartphones &mdash; for their media consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for every challenge there is an opportunity, and in 2013, it&rsquo;s going to be one that, at first blush, sounds like an oxymoron. But upon further review, it makes all the sense in the world: working hyperlocal tactics into your national marketing strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hyperlocal at national scale</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using &ldquo;big data&rdquo; to gain a true understanding of the interests of individuals living in a particular area, you can target based on interest without relying on cookie-based targeting. According to comScore, only 25 percent of an intended audience is typically found with a cookie-based campaign, making it impossible to achieve the same scale as a campaign based on individual neighborhood interests and preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperlocal digital intelligence presents media professionals with a unique opportunity to promote their clients&rsquo; brands to the best potential customers. And by including a hyperlocal strategy in their national media plans, buyers are creating cost-effective plans that deliver greater returns &mdash; which is more important than ever in these uncertain times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHyperlocal is all about effectively targeting consumers at a geo-granular level. In addition, targeting neighborhoods that are in close proximity to store locations is a critical component. And, according to U.S. Census data, 75 percent of consumer spending happens within 15 miles of the home &mdash; a staggering number that supports the case for hyperlocal targeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using this pinpointed targeting approach, brands can eliminate wasteful spending associated with traditional campaigns that rely on blanketed marketing. Consider the millions of ad dollars wasted each year on national campaigns that aren&rsquo;t truly for everyone. Take, for example, the CPG manufacturer&nbsp;that wants to create targeted awareness of&nbsp;its brand for all of&nbsp;its buyers. Not everyone in the country is an intended buyer of the brand; however,&nbsp;it still needs to target a lot of people, but need to be smart about it. Imagine a better, more efficient, and effective way to target existing and prospective customers. A retailer like West Elm, for example, may want to reach a national audience, but does not have a dense footprint like other national retailers, such as Target. West Elm can create targeted campaigns that reach the most likely buyers of its products within an eight-mile radius of all its stores across the country. It still gets the benefit of a national campaign &mdash; driving people to&nbsp;its stores nationally &mdash; with the precision of a hyperlocal approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to achieve this level of precision, media agencies are turning to &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions. An effective solution is one that can analyze billions of offline and online data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S., such as point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines. The data can be used to score each neighborhood and determine its interests &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s neighborhoods across the country with residents most interested in a healthier lifestyle, in the market for a new car, or who currently use your competitor&rsquo;s product. By analyzing the data sets, companies can look at clusters of people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services.Here are a few tips for incorporating a hyperlocal element into your national campaign plans:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Complement traditional campaigns</strong><br />\r\nIn many cases, agencies begin experimenting with hyperlocal approaches by complementing existing client campaigns, such as direct mail or a national TV spot. Assets from these campaigns can easily be reused to target only those most likely purchasers in specific neighborhoods closest to store locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Think beyond traditional tactics</strong><br />\r\nWhile you may be accustomed to targeting a demographic within a specific designated marketing area, it&rsquo;s time to get laser-focused and move your clients&rsquo; products off the shelves. By leveraging the analysis of billions of offline and online data points, including POS data, you can eliminate wasteful ad spending by focusing on the most likely buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t rely on cookies</strong><br />\r\nBy using &ldquo;big data&rdquo; to gain a true understanding of the interests of individuals living in a particular area, you can target based on interest without relying on cookie-based targeting. According to comScore, only 25 percent of an intended audience is typically found with a cookie-based campaign, making it impossible to achieve the same scale as a campaign based on individual neighborhood interests and preferences. Hyperlocal digital intelligence presents media professionals with a unique opportunity to promote their clients&rsquo; brands to the best potential customers. And by including a hyperlocal strategy in their national media plans, buyers are creating cost-effective plans that deliver greater returns &mdash; which is more important than ever in these uncertain times.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How to go hyperlocal on a national scale ", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.imediaconnection.com/"	\N	2013-05-14 23:26:33.646846	2013-08-27 20:25:38.847247

In 2011, the National Retail Federation (NRF) reported that spending during the four-day weekend following Thanksgiving had reached $52.4 billion, up 16% from the prior year. On Black Friday&mdash;one of the most important shopping days of the year&mdash;consumers looking for the best deals crowd stores at all hours of the day. In most cases, they&rsquo;ve spent time looking at digital ads, emails, and circulars to help guide their shopping plans for the big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the NRF predicting $586.1 billion in holiday sales up for grabs this year, it&rsquo;s more important than ever for brands and retailers to reach the right shoppers online before they head to the store. And when it comes to locating the shoppers most looking for a bargain, there are 10 specific cities to keep in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We analyzed offline and online data points&mdash;including point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines&mdash;to identify the top 10 cost-conscious cities in the United States. Shoppers in these cities are most likely to watch their budgets and stick to items on sale when ticking gifts off their holiday shopping lists:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Top 10</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Erie, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Leesburg, VA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Athens, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenville, SC</li>\r\n\t<li>Lakeland, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Waco, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Pine City, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Richmond, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Hattiesburg, MS</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nZoom in on neighborhoods in these cities, and you&rsquo;ll notice similarities among their residents. Cost-conscious shoppers tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have children</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Make between $40,000 and $60,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a college education or less schooling<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Above all else, they share an interest in long-term savings, which they achieve by incrementally purchasing items at a lower cost. To entice these shoppers into stores on Black Friday, advertisers often find that digital ads promoting coupons, deep discounts during special hours, and other bargain-friendly deals are the most successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s More</strong><br />\r\nTake a closer look at the top city on the list&mdash;Erie, Pennsylvania&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll see that not all cost-conscious consumers are purchasing the same products. While some are looking for a great deal on a new tablet for their tech-savvy daughters, others are searching for the ultimate gaming system for their teenage sons. Erie&rsquo;s cost-conscious neighborhoods are interested in different products this holiday season:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neighborhoods Interested in Tech Gadgets</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Glenwood</li>\r\n\t<li>Weber Hills</li>\r\n\t<li>Eaglehurst</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNeighborhoods Interested in Gaming</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Edinboro</li>\r\n\t<li>Cambridge Springs</li>\r\n\t<li>North East Township</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCheck out the infographic at the end of this report to learn more about these neighborhoods, including what they&rsquo;re searching for online and which products they&rsquo;re purchasing in stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nCampaigns that target the wrong audience can be frustrating and expensive for retailers, brands, and agencies, especially during a critical selling period such as the holidays. By taking a hyperlocal approach to digital advertising and focusing on the neighborhoods that are not<br />\r\njust interested in deals this season but deals for your specific type of product or service, you can make sure you get the most out of your holiday advertising efforts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buy Theirs, Get Ours Free</strong> &ndash; For one of the largest and fastest-growing employee-owned supermarket chains in the United States, MaxPoint implemented a &ldquo;buy theirs, get ours free&rdquo; campaign. We targeted cost-conscious neighborhoods within a 10-mile radius of select locations with an offer to purchase a national brand&rsquo;s product and receive the supermarket chain&rsquo;s equivalent for free. The campaign drove traffic to store locations and increased consumers&rsquo; perception of the generic brand&rsquo;s value. The campaign also achieved a strong CTR, which led the supermarket chain to increase its budget during the campaign&rsquo;s flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Save on Gas</strong> &ndash; For a supermarket chain with more than 200 stores in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, MaxPoint implemented a digital advertising campaign targeting those shoppers most interested in holiday bargains. The chain offered shoppers savings on gas when they purchased $50 in holiday gift cards&mdash;available for more than 150 retailers&mdash;at the chain&rsquo;s stores. The campaign resulted in a CTR that substantially exceeded the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Erie Tops the List of Cities Looking for a Holiday Bargain", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/09/03/11_10_00_413_Cities_Looking_for_a_Holiday_Bargain_A_MaxPoint_Interactive_Interest_Index_2012.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Cities Looking for a Holiday Bargain_A MaxPoint Interactive Interest Index_2012.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "header_image_uid"=>NULL, "header_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/06/08_30_35_194_holiday_bargain.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"holiday-bargain.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMDMvMTFfMTBfMDBfNDEzX0NpdGllc19Mb29raW5nX2Zvcl9hX0hvbGlkYXlfQmFyZ2Fpbl9BX01heFBvaW50X0ludGVyYWN0aXZlX0ludGVyZXN0X0luZGV4XzIwMTIucGRmIl1d/Cities%20Looking%20for%20a%20Holiday%20Bargain_A%20MaxPoint%20Interactive%20Interest%20Index_2012.pdf"	\N	2013-05-14 22:02:00.418671	2013-09-21 01:16:50.037971
541	68	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C. &ndash; January 31, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;As the flu virus spreads across the U.S.,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>MaxPoint</u></a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, announced its latest Interest Index, which reveals the cities most interested in flu-related remedies. Huntsville, Alabama tops the list of cities most concerned by the epidemic, closely followed by Knoxville, Tennessee and Greensboro, North Carolina. Utilizing these insights, advertisers can tailor hyperlocal digital campaigns to the right neighborhoods, thereby maximizing in-store purchases of flu-related products &mdash; from facial tissues and chicken soup, to antibacterial spray and over-the-counter flu drugs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of January 5, 47 states had reported widespread geographic flu activity. Boston and New York City have even gone so far as to declare citywide health emergencies. Despite these developments, these two cities didn&rsquo;t make the top 10 when it came to consumer concern surrounding the virus, highlighting how crucial it is for advertisers to dive deep into neighborhood and audience data &mdash; rather than depend on assumptions &mdash; when building their campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy analyzing billions of in-store purchases and online data points, MaxPoint found that the 10 cities most interested in all things flu-related are the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Huntsville, AL<br />\r\n2. Knoxville, TN<br />\r\n3. Greensboro, NC<br />\r\n4. Greenville, SC<br />\r\n5. Des Moines, IA<br />\r\n6. Rochester, NY<br />\r\n7. Birmingham, AL<br />\r\n8. Boise, ID<br />\r\n9. Augusta, GA<br />\r\n10. Milwaukee, WI<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo further help retailers and brands find the right shoppers for their products, the Interest Index layered additional levels of data to determine that neighborhoods within Huntsville, Alabama &mdash; the city most concerned about the flu &mdash; differ in their preferences for generic and brand-name products. For example, the Darwin Downs, Nolan Hills and Rainbow neighborhoods show more interest in generic products, while the West Huntsville and Windsor Manor neighborhoods tend to purchase brand-name remedies for their flu symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nShoppers purchasing flu-related items in the top cities tend to share certain characteristics. On average, these shoppers are 36 years old, own their homes, and make between $50,000 and $60,000 per year. Most of these shoppers have at least a high school education and have children. The similarities go well beyond basic demographics. A closer examination reveals that those concerned with the flu also search for similar subjects online and make comparable in-store purchases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, MaxPoint ran several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A global pharmaceutical company with a diverse healthcare portfolio &mdash; including pharmaceuticals, eye care products and vaccines &mdash; wanted to drive adults over the age of 65 to select pharmacy locations to receive flu shots. Using MaxPoint&rsquo;s hyperlocal advertising approach, the company achieved 164 percent lift in awareness of its flu vaccine at participating pharmacies.</li>\r\n\t<li>A manufacturer of analgesics wanted to increase brand awareness and drive sales of its products. By running digital ads with MaxPoint, the manufacturer achieved 3 percent sales lift in mass merchandise stores.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Flu activity is heightened across nearly every state in the nation right now, making this a great time for advertisers to promote products that appeal to flu-ridden and flu-fearing shoppers,&rdquo; commented MaxPoint COO Gretchen Joyce. &ldquo;By targeting these shoppers on the neighborhood level, brands advertising flu remedies can find the most-qualified consumers for specific products, thereby increasing in-store foot traffic and purchases.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. For the January Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of online topics related to consumers&rsquo; interest in the flu virus, including pneumonia, flu shots, body aches, flu remedies and urgent care centers. In addition, MaxPoint evaluated neighborhoods&rsquo; purchases of flu remedies, such as facial tissues, hand sanitizer, chicken soup, TheraFlu&reg;, Tylenol&reg;&nbsp;Cold and Flu Severe, and cough drops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers, brands, and multi-location business owners.

1059	145	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>The school year is over, and summer vacation has begun. But while kids can take a break, retailers can&rsquo;t. In just a few short months, families will begin buying school supplies like notebooks, pencils, and calculators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back-to-school market is quite profitable. According to the National Retail Federation&rsquo;s (NRF) back-to-school spending survey, parents spent an average of $688 on new backpacks, fall sweaters, footwear, and electronics.[1] But it&rsquo;s not just school supplies that sell&mdash;clothing and kid&rsquo;s apparel are also big sellers. In fact, on clothing and accessories alone, the NRF reported that back-to-school spending totaled $10.8 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help children&rsquo;s apparel retailers target back-to-school shoppers, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to find neighborhoods that over-index for back-to-school clothing purchases. We built out profiles of the shoppers, including their demographics and interests. Additionally, our access to credit card data allowed us to develop a comprehensive view of spending patterns for the shoppers, including their purchases in other product categories. We also compiled lists of the top cities in which a high percentage of neighborhoods match the target profile, making it easier for advertisers to reach the right cities and neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience Profiles: Seasonal Spenders and Year-Round Spenders</strong><br />\r\nOnce we started analyzing the data, we discovered that there were two distinct audiences that buy kid&rsquo;s apparel: seasonal spenders and year-round spenders. Both audiences buy back-to-school clothing, but their audience profiles and spending patterns diverge.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeasonal spenders purchase children&rsquo;s clothing in large quantities during the back-to-school season, but don&rsquo;t purchase children&rsquo;s apparel throughout the rest of the year in the same capacity. These seasonal spenders share the following characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Their incomes usually total $60,000 per year or less</li>\r\n\t<li>They tend to be older, often over 55 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>They own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re married <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing our proprietary interest data, we found that seasonal spenders are interested in food and drink trends, allergy relief, NASCAR, new technology, fashion, home improvement, and retirement planning. Our purchase data analysis revealed that these families often spend their money at value grocery stores, sporting goods and apparel stores, automotive retail stores, music and video entertainment stores, and office supply chains. This audience may be extended family members, such as grandparents, buying gifts and clothing for children for the back-to-school season. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe year-round shoppers purchased a lot of children&rsquo;s apparel during the back-to-school season, but they also steadily purchased kid&rsquo;s clothing throughout the rest of the year. This audience tends to have the following characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Their incomes exceed the $100,000 per year mark</li>\r\n\t<li>They have college degrees</li>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re typically between the ages of 35 and 44 &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTheir interests include beauty, food and drink trends, the economy, business and finance, golf, weddings, and fashion. In addition to their family apparel purchases, they can frequently be found shopping at women&rsquo;s apparel stores, department stores, and drug stores. Similar to their seasonal counterparts, they also purchase products at video and music stores. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Where to Find Them</strong> &nbsp;<br />\r\nSome cities tend to have higher concentrations of back-to-school shoppers than others. We&rsquo;ve compiled a list of the top cities for both audiences. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Top Areas for Seasonal Shoppers</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Charleston, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Eureka, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Madison, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Shreveport, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo get down to the neighborhood level, we looked within Oklahoma City and found that the top neighborhoods were Covington, Douglas, and Hayward. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Top Areas for Year-Round Shoppers</em> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD</li>\r\n\t<li>Huntsville, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Savannah, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Terre Haute, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Flagstaff, AZ&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWithin Flagstaff, we found that the highest indexing neighborhoods for year-round kid&rsquo;s apparel shoppers were Equestrian Estates, Pine Del, and Railroad Springs.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong> &nbsp;<br />\r\nHyperlocal digital advertising gives clothing and apparel advertisers more targeting power than they can get with traditional advertising. By using purchase data, advertisers can find out who buys. By using geo-targeting, they can find out where they buy. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data from this interest index, advertisers can allocate portions of their advertising budget to reach the right neighborhoods at the right time. For example, a company that makes children&rsquo;s sneakers could run ads for most of the year in the year-round spender neighborhoods. Then, as September comes closer, they can start increasing their budgets to seasonal-spender neighborhoods. This boosts their responses and keeps their ad spend efficient. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond their targeting, advertisers can also learn to change their creative based on the audience. For example, they may want to focus on branding and quality for the year-round families, while focusing on low prices for the seasonal spenders. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year&rsquo;s back-to-school season promises to be an excellent one for children&rsquo;s apparel retailers and advertisers. Ultimately, the companies that will best capitalize are those that use offline and online data sources to target the right neighborhoods with the right messages at the right times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong> &nbsp;<br />\r\nMaxPoint has used its Digital Zip technology to run hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns for several retailers&rsquo; back-to-school promotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Electronics Retailer&mdash;</strong>A national electronics retailer wanted to build awareness of its brand and products while also driving in-store sales at its locations for the back-to-school months. To help them, MaxPoint targeted households with kids between the ages of 18 and 24 and interests in college and college living. Additionally, MaxPoint focused on a tight 6 to 8 mile radius of the store. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was over 4 times the industry average. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Arts and Crafts Retailer&mdash;</strong>An arts and crafts retailer wanted to drive customers to its stores for several back-to-school promotions. MaxPoint helped by targeting two audiences: teachers and mothers. The teacher audience was primarily made up of women between the ages of 25 and 55, while the mother audience was made up of women between 35 and 55 with heavy purchases of craft supplies. The campaign targeted neighborhoods within 10 miles of the retailer&rsquo;s locations that over-indexed for the two audiences. The campaign resulted in a CTR for the two audiences that was 3 times the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <a href=\\"http://www.nrf.com/backtoschool\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>http://www.nrf.com/backtoschool</u></a></p>\r\n", "title"=>"Not Too Cool for School: Who Is Buying Back-to-School Apparel?", "pdf_uid"=>"2014/01/13/11_36_28_116_Not_Too_Cool_for_School_Who_s_Buying_Back_to_School_Apparel_A_MaxPoint_Interest_Index_2013.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Not Too Cool for School_Who's Buying Back to School Apparel_A MaxPoint Interest Index_2013.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "header_image_uid"=>NULL, "header_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/05/18_01_35_367_school_apparel.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"school-apparel.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDEvMTMvMTFfMzZfMjhfMTE2X05vdF9Ub29fQ29vbF9mb3JfU2Nob29sX1dob19zX0J1eWluZ19CYWNrX3RvX1NjaG9vbF9BcHBhcmVsX0FfTWF4UG9pbnRfSW50ZXJlc3RfSW5kZXhfMjAxMy5wZGYiXV0/Not%20Too%20Cool%20for%20School_Who%27s%20Buying%20Back%20to%20School%20Apparel_A%20MaxPoint%20Interest%20Index_2013.pdf"	\N	2013-06-25 14:13:07.84235	2014-01-13 17:37:13.367701

Based on the research, MaxPoint found that the typical seasonal spender makes $60,000 a year or less, is over the age of 55, owns their home and is married. They trend high in interest on topics such as food and drink trends, allergy relief, NASCAR, home improvement and retirement planning. Seasonal-spender families most often spend their money at value grocery stores, sporting goods and apparel stores and office supply chains. Given the demographics, this audience is likely made up of grandparents and other family members purchasing gifts and clothing for children specifically for the back-to-school season. The U.S. cities that had the highest percentage of neighborhoods on the seasonal spender index were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Charleston, WV</li>\r\n\t<li>Eureka, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Madison, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Shreveport, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The Profile of a Year-Round Spender</strong><br />\r\nUnlike their seasonal spender counterparts, the year-round spenders purchased high quantities of children&rsquo;s clothing both during the back-to-school season and throughout the rest of the year. MaxPoint found that the typical year-round spender makes more than $100,000 per year, has a college degree and is typically between the ages of 35 and 44. This group trends high on interest in topics such as the economy, business and finance, weddings and fashion. They tend to shop most often at women&rsquo;s apparel stores, department stores and drug stores. The U.S. cities that had the highest percentage of neighborhoods on the year-round spender index were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD</li>\r\n\t<li>Huntsville, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Savannah, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Terre Haute, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Flagstaff, AZ</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint found that, even within the top cities, certain neighborhoods indexed higher than others for seasonal versus year-round shopping for children&rsquo;s clothes. For instance, within Oklahoma City, the neighborhoods of Covington, Douglas and Hayward trended high for having the most seasonal shoppers. While the Equestrian Estates, Pine Del and Railroad Springs sections of Flagstaff, AZ were among the most likely to spend year round.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Back-to-school is hugely profitable for brands and retailers alike. However, it&rsquo;s critical for these advertisers to be able to sustain high sales activity throughout the rest of the year, and targeted advertising plays a big role in that process,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint. &ldquo;We help advertisers understand who is buying, when they are buying, what they are buying and where they are buying &ndash; which enables them to personalize and deliver their messages based on the specific audience.&nbsp; Advertisers that capitalize by using offline and online data to better understand consumers will be the most profitable during the upcoming back-to-school season.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint used its Digital Zip technology to run hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns for several retailers&rsquo; back-to-school promotions including: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An electronics retailer that wanted to build awareness of its brands and products, while driving in-store sales at its various locations during back-to-school shopping months.

569	82	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Gretchen Joyce, COO,&nbsp;MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on</em> <em>eM+C.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>May 22, 2012</strong> <strong>&ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Retail marketers understand the need to incorporate digital into their marketing mix, but they may not know what specific (and proven) tactics can increase the success of their campaign initiatives. Too often retailers turn to digital ads to drive e-commerce traffic and traditional ads to drive foot traffic to their stores. By approaching campaigns this way, retail marketers are missing the boat on the enormous power of digital to drive in-store traffic. In fact, research from Forrester predicts that the web will influence $1.4 trillion of in-store sales by 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn today&rsquo;s advertising world, there are an increasing number of mediums to consider when planning a campaign. Oftentimes ad campaigns are put into &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital&rdquo; buckets instead of leveraging them together to increase their effectiveness. By using digital to complement traditional, retailers can drill down to specific customer segments for more precise and effective campaigns. For instance, a campaign might focus on traditional media (e.g., television, print or direct mail) or it might rely on display ads to reach prospects. Rather than looking at these strategies as siloed efforts, it&rsquo;s time to move them under one umbrella, where traditional ad components can be complemented by localized digital ads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith most consumers shopping within a 15-mile radius of their home, retailers know the importance of local advertising strategies, even if they&rsquo;re a national chain. They&rsquo;re using a variety of tactics to reach local audiences, from SMS texting campaigns to reach customers in specific cities to geotargeting social outlets to match specific demographics, retailers understand the general areas where their customers live. In many cases, however, a city or demographic isn&rsquo;t as targeted as it could be. Why spend extra ad dollars on neighborhoods that are irrelevant to your brand?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor retailers, having knowledge about specific neighborhoods within a certain radius of their stores leads to campaign savings and increased revenue. More importantly, it leads to incredibly effective digital campaigns that drive in-store traffic. Thanks to &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; &mdash; i.e., the technology methodology that stores and processes petabytes of data &mdash; this level of pinpointing is possible within digital ad campaigns. Retailers and the brands they carry can leverage billions of data points across all U.S. neighborhoods, including offline point-of-sale data, social media data, videos, music, local web pages, online magazines, demographic, interest data, psychographics and more. This data enables retailers to target campaigns and promotions to a highly specific demographic of prospects, leading to the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Increased loyalty.&nbsp;</strong>By targeting at the neighborhood-level, customers will (unknowingly and otherwise) appreciate the customization and applicability of a retailer&rsquo;s products and offerings to their specific interests and demographic. This will encourage repeat visits and purchases, as well as positive word-of-mouth influence.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Increased brand awareness.&nbsp;</strong>This wealth of data opens up new opportunities to hit local consumers at scale that were otherwise unreachable through traditional ad delivery.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Decreased ad waste.&nbsp;</strong>By leveraging such specific and targeted data, national ad campaigns can reach consumers in an exact mile radius, weeding out areas of demographics that aren&rsquo;t valuable to the retailer.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reused assets.</strong>&nbsp;Traditional ad campaigns can take weeks, even months, to create, requiring retailers to plan well in advance when they want to drive traffic to their stores. By reusing assets originally designed for TV, print, email, etc. in a localized, neighborhood-level digital campaign (e.g., online video ads), retailers can increase the return on investment on their creative spend while creating just-in-time demand for their products or offers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nRetailers aren&rsquo;t the only ones experiencing the benefits of neighborhood-level digital campaigns. The brands (i.e., suppliers) they carry in their stores can also leverage this data to create demand at the store-level. This strategy shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored. As e-commerce and other channels put increased pressure on retail stores, it&rsquo;s imperative that stores look to new digital strategies to continuously drive foot traffic.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Complementing Traditional Ads With Digital?

The research revealed that only 20 percent of respondents think consumers use digital mediums to prepare for their shopping trips. However, a BIGinsight study released yesterday found that 90 percent of consumers regularly research products online before purchasing them in store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, the MaxPoint research found that, in a post-recession economy, consumers are trying to find the best ways to maximize their monthly spend. Some of these news habits as reported by the Grocery Industry Pulse: &ldquo;Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer,&rdquo; include: shopping at multiple stores to find the best prices and deals; a heavier reliance on coupons and sales and an increase in research on digital channels before making an in-store purchase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo compare these findings, executives at FMI2012 were asked how they&rsquo;ve seen their shoppers&rsquo; behaviors change in the past year to determine if they are using the most effective methods to reach today&rsquo;s grocery shopper. Key findings from the survey conducted on the show floor include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExecutives are aware that consumers are shopping multiple grocery stores: Consumers can expect to see increased incentive to complete their shopping in one location, as approximately 35 percent of grocery executives recognized that shoppers have become less store-loyal and more cost-conscious. Approximately 15 percent of respondents said that consumers are more frequently shopping at discount stores and club stores like Costco and Sam&rsquo;s Club.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsumers are Shopping Closer to Home: Approximately 30 percent of respondents recognized that consumers now tend to shop at grocery stores closest to their home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCoupons and Sales Aren&rsquo;t Going Anywhere: Approximately 32 percent of executives shared that they have seen an increase in the use of print coupons, while 31 percent have seen an increase in the use of digital/mobile coupons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSplurging Has Taken a Backseat: Twenty percent of executives shared that &ldquo;splurging&rdquo; on items at the grocery store has been cut back. They said consumers are just buying what is needed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;As more consumers are increasingly using digital mediums to prepare for their in-store shopping experience, it was interesting to see a varying point of view from grocery executives around these changing shopper behaviors,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;The combination of our research and BIGinsight&rsquo;s report provide great insights into how consumers now make purchasing decisions and the role that digital plays in those decisions. We&rsquo;ve learned that consumers are doing more research online before buying in the store, shopping closer to home and are highly influenced by incentives and coupons.

Goldman<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared in</em> Shopper Marketing<em> magazine.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>July 2012 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;To increase sales of its Huggies Snug &amp; Dry diapers at Sam&rsquo;s Club earlier this year, Kimberly-Clark wanted to hone in on a highly specific audience within a very limited geographical radius &ndash; moms aged 18-34, with children aged 0-2, living within a couple of miles of a Sam&rsquo;s Club. The consumer packaged goods maker also wanted to reach Sam&rsquo;s online-centric audience through display advertising, but without blanketing the Web with ads served up to those uninterested in diapers or not located near a Sam&rsquo;s warehouse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe solution was highly targeted, data-driven digital advertising, a fairly new option that is vastly expanding and moving the needle for brand marketers. A host of data analytics companies, media publishers, online advertising networks and agencies have jumped on board the hyperlocal bandwagon in the hopes of snagging a piece of the lucrative national brand spend pie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven just a couple of years ago, Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s current goal of using targeted digital ads down to the neighborhood level, combined with an understanding of shopper segments and purchase behavior, at the large scale necessary would have been an impossibly tall order. &ldquo;We want to eliminate waste in delivering impressions,&rdquo; says Richard Moulton, marketing director for Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club teams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about getting more segmented and targeted &ndash; serving up ads at the right time, in the right place, to the right audience.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe targeted digital advertising industry, still in its early stages, has become a highly confusing and fragmented landscape of complex technologies and a tough-to-track value chain. Nevertheless, CPGs have begun to test the targeted waters, shifting some spend to companies combining online and offline data with highly sophisticated analytics technologies &ndash; promising digital ad targeting at the ZIP code level (and beyond) that can also be tied to in-store sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>IP Addresses, Cookies and Beyond</strong><br />\r\nThanks to improved targeting and back-end measurement, overall online advertising spend has been on the rise and will cruise past print budgets for the first time this year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. U.S. online ad spending grew 23% to $32.03 billion in 2011, and it is predicted to grow to $39.5 billion in 2012, which would put it above total U.S. magazine and newspaper spending, according to eMarketer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut while so-called digital geo-targeting &ndash; serving up online ads to those in a specific geographical radius &ndash; has been around since the mid-2000s through the use of IP address data (the numerical label assigned to a computer on a network), its success was limited in terms of precision. For example, IP addresses for most AOL users came from a Virginia server, even though AOL users lived around the country, so ads served up to AOL subscribers may or may not have been geographically appropriate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd even as proximity targeting became more accurate, usually through the use of Internet &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; (a piece of data stored in a computer&rsquo;s browser that can be used as identification and/or proof of where the user is online), it was still no easy task to determine whether these Web surfers were the right audience in terms of lifestyle segment or purchase behavior &ndash; that of young moms with infants and toddlers, for example.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Neighborhood-Level Targeting</strong><br />\r\nToday&rsquo;s hyperlocal offerings use highly sophisticated analytics to layer and combine different types of data with the latest digital technology to serve up ads to an audience of pinpointed prospects in specific neighborhoods &ndash; often on a very large scale of millions of impressions. Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s work in January with Morrisville, N.C.-based hyperlocal data analytics company&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a> on the Huggies/Sam&rsquo;s Club challenge is an example of this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint&rsquo;s solution</a>&nbsp;cross-references IP addresses with point-of-sale data provided by retailers, and then uses proprietary analytics technology to determine which U.S. neighborhoods over-index for a certain behavior or lifestyle, such as young moms. It uses the results to determine ad network media buys, which then serve up appropriate display ads to the right target audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically the concept of &lsquo;birds of a feather flock together,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Gretchen Joyce, MaxPoint&rsquo;s chief operating officer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hitting one person or one house, but all of the folks in a neighborhood within the right radius of a store where the client is trying to drive sales. That&rsquo;s what gets the volume you need to not just bring in one appropriate customer into a store, but hundreds and thousands.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHistorically, Joyce points out, CPGs have spent most of their marketing dollars leveraging print, direct mail, in-store promotions and out-of-home marketing. That is changing, however, as granular digital advertising options can help CPGs get just as targeted as direct mail, but online advertising allows for more flexibility and real-time shifts in algorithms or creative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Connecting Offline to Online</strong><br />\r\nOne of MaxPoint&rsquo;s competitors in the targeted digital advertising space, Westminster, Colo.-based Datalogix, refers to these types of hyperlocal campaigns as &ldquo;digital direct marketing.&rdquo; However, the firm, which has a strong heritage in offline direct marketing, determines its target audience differently than MaxPoint.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Rob Holland, Datalogix&rsquo;s general manager in charge of the consumer products vertical, the company works with the CPG or retail client to determine what audience it is looking to reach. Then, it does a study of those category buyers and creates an online audience by analyzing in-store purchase data and using the Datalogix proprietary database of more than 110 million households.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;We have the ability to match offline data to online data,&rdquo; says Holland. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a CPG selling a packaged food product and I want to reach people who buy my product, shop in my category or have other types of product affinities such as skewing toward organic. We can build that audience by matching offline CRM files to online cookie information &ndash; we&rsquo;ve made the investment to create significant relationships across the Web where we can match millions of cookies and connect our offline databases to our online audiences.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome consider the use of cookies to be a privacy red flag in terms of gathering personally identifiable information, but Holland insists Datalogix&rsquo;s cookie use is anonymous. MaxPoint, however, makes a point of noting its lack of cookie use in hyperlocal targeting, as does another competitor in the neighborhood-level ad targeting space, a Chicago-area agency and unit of IPG Mediabrands called Geomentum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLisa Bradner, a former Forrester Research analyst and now general manager at Geomentum and its sister company, Shopper Sciences, says the company uses its own proprietary research on shopper segments and behavior and combines it with ZIP code-level geographic data as well as, in some cases, point-of-sale or loyalty data provided by the client to determine the right display ad audience. She does admit that Geomentum sometimes does media buys with partner companies who use cookies, and that cookie use, the retention of the cookie data and other issues typically depend on the client&rsquo;s needs, policies and decision-making.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Duking It Out for the Right Data</strong><br />\r\nMore data, Bradner points out, shouldn&rsquo;t always be the goal when it comes to hyperlocal targeting. Getting down to the single household level, she explains, may not provide the necessary scale for the client or meet its campaign needs. &ldquo;Too much data can actually be a trap for the marketer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about winning the shopper at the neighborhood level.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a longtime player in the digital advertising game such as publisher Yahoo, Sunnyvale, Calif., the secret sauce is in a name and address data file of more than 150 million U.S. consumers, or nearly half of the U.S. population. &ldquo;Addressability&rdquo; is the unique key to its geographic targeted offerings, according to Jeff Minich, product marketer, audience targeting, at Yahoo, who says the company provides geo-targeted advertising solutions to clients that combine Yahoo&rsquo;s name and address data with frequent shopper data and measurement courtesy of data partners such as Nielsen Catalina, Cincinnati; Experian, Costa Mesa, Calif.; and Acxiom, Little Rock, Ark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;We rely on user registration data to determine what proximity-based segments a user falls into for targeting &ndash; so we target based on actual home address vs. a log-in location,&rdquo; says Minich. After all, he explains, users may log in at home, at work, or while traveling, but they tend to do their shopping within 15 miles of home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYahoo also avoids &ldquo;cookie churn,&rdquo; or the rate at which cookies are cleared or deleted from a person&rsquo;s computer with its method, says Minich. &ldquo;It enables us to serve ads to a consistent audience over time.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Learning Curve</strong><br />\r\nWith vendors of all shapes and sizes vying for a share of brand spend in hyperlocal digital advertising, it&rsquo;s unclear what kind of solution will take the lead and what type of targeting &ndash; from cookies and IP-level targeting to offline point-of-sale or ZIP code algorithms &ndash; will prevail in this fragmented universe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Digital advertising is like a jump ball right now,&rdquo; says Bradner. &ldquo;No one knows who&rsquo;s going to grab it.&rdquo; The only certainty, she adds, is that &ldquo;the shopper is at the center of everything &ndash; and you have to find that shopper.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the landscape still in an era of experimentation, Datalogix&rsquo;s Holland says the industry remains in the early phases of the learning curve &ndash; and CPG brand marketers are struggling to meet the challenge and keep up with the pace of change. &ldquo;This space has really grown up beneath the CPGs and retail advertisers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of learning going on.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough its work with MaxPoint, Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Moulton is one of the marketers studying the learning curve, and while he may not fully understand the analytical depths of how MaxPoint&rsquo;s solution works, he is basing his judgment on the campaign&rsquo;s results. Those results are promising thus far, but he points out that the jury is still out &ndash; and that hyperlocal, targeted digital advertising remains only a small part of the company&rsquo;s mix of marketing channels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing click-through rates above industry norms, but we&rsquo;re not yet completely satisfied,&rdquo; Moulton says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased with the program&rsquo;s results, and I appreciate its flexibility and ability to shift in real time, but we still want to raise the bar higher.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>CPG marketers are increasingly turning to digital advertising campaigns that target potential shoppers based on their location, even at the neighborhood level.</li>\r\n\t<li>Targeted digital advertising, still in its early stages, has become a confusing and fragmented landscape of complex technologies and a tough-to-track value chain.</li>\r\n\t<li>Kimberly-Clark has targeted young moms living within a couple of miles of Sam&rsquo;s Club locations with ads for Huggies Snug &amp; Dry diapers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Online ad spending is predicted to surpass magazine/newspaper spending this year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Solution providers such as MaxPoint Interactive, Datalogix, Geomentum and Yahoo help CPGs target online consumers using IP addresses and cookies as well as POS and other data from various data partners.</li>\r\n\t<li>One exec says digital advertising is a jump ball right now.

And if you&rsquo;re a national garden supply retailer, the time is ripe for an advertising push that puts your lawn and garden tools into the right households all across the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the 2012 National Gardening Survey, the US lawn and garden market totaled $29.1 billion in 2011.[1] The survey also reported that home improvement centers and mass merchants claim about 51% of the market share, which demonstrates their dominance over garden nurseries and hardware stores. But even though green thumbs are shifting dollars to the larger retailers, there&rsquo;s still a lot of market share for retailers to gain. The best way to capture more market share is by running a hyperlocal digital campaign. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help garden supply companies better reach their customers, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip&reg; technology to pull information about the neighborhoods most interested in gardening in the United States. We looked at data for both the do-it-yourself (DIY) residential gardening market as well as the market for professional landscaping services. As a result of our research, we found two major audience profiles&mdash;green thumbs and brown thumbs. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>On Green Thumbs and Brown Thumbs</em>&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen it comes to DIY gardening, green thumbs cultivate their own gardens and seek out lawn care and garden care information. Brown thumbs are the opposite&mdash;they don&rsquo;t tend their own gardens and don&rsquo;t spend much of their time reading up on gardening. Brown thumbs are still interested in curb appeal; they just don&rsquo;t want to do it themselves. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, who fits into each of the profiles?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green Thumb Consumer Profile</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nGreen thumbs tend to share the following characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They are typically over 55 years of age.</li>\r\n\t<li>Their incomes usually range between $20,000 and $60,000 per year.</li>\r\n\t<li>They own their homes.</li>\r\n\t<li>They typically have children.</li>\r\n\t<li>They usually haven&rsquo;t completed college. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith many green thumbs over the retirement age, they likely have more time to spend in their gardens than many brown thumbs do. And, because some are on a fixed income, they save money by skipping the costs incurred using professional landscaping services. But the extra time and fixed income doesn&rsquo;t explain everything&mdash;many home gardeners find the activity extremely relaxing and rewarding. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint also used its proprietary interest data to uncover overlapping interests among the green thumbs. Unsurprisingly, we found that the audience was strongly interested in eco-friendly living and home improvement. But we also found that the green thumb crowd consumes a lot of content on law and government.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Brown Thumb Consumer Profile</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nBrown thumbs, or shoppers with a lower interest in DIY gardening, share the following characteristics: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re typically between the ages of 18 and 44.</li>\r\n\t<li>Their incomes exceed $80,000 per year.</li>\r\n\t<li>They own their homes.</li>\r\n\t<li>They usually have college degrees. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBrown thumbs tend to be younger than green thumbs. Many of them have busy careers that prevent them from spending much of their time on beautifying their homes. That may put them in the right market for lawn and garden products that take less time and effort. And, with a higher income, they can afford to outsource their gardening and lawn care to professional landscapers. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint found that brown thumbs tend to be highly interested in extreme sports, fashion, and heart health. We also found that many brown thumbs frequently research allergy relief products, which may contribute to their lack of interest in gardening. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Where to Find Them</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nGreen thumbs and brown thumbs sometimes live in the same cities. But interestingly, they often live in different neighborhoods within these cities. Digital Zips, or neighborhoods, with heavy concentrations of both green thumbs and brown thumbs are located in the following cities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ft. Smith, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>New Orleans, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Oklahoma City, OK</li>\r\n\t<li>Santa Fe, NM</li>\r\n\t<li>Shreveport, LA &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf advertisers target these cities, they&#39;ll reach both green thumbs and brown thumbs, even if they&#39;re only trying to target one group. So, is there a way to target only one group efficiently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nTo truly maximize ROI, advertisers who wish to target either green thumbs or brown thumbs are better off focusing on the neighborhood level. The DMA is a great start, but only neighborhood-level targeting truly reduces ad waste while homing in on the right shoppers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to location, advertisers also need to look at the audience profile. Because many green thumbs are further along in life than the brown thumbs, gardening and outdoor living retailers must use the data for a specific neighborhood to serve the right creative to the right shoppers. For example, garden supply retailers might create advertisements that focus on the relaxing nature of gardening, and then deliver the ads to residents in neighborhoods with heavy concentrations of established families and retirees who have a strong interest in gardening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end, advertisers should use both these profiles and locations to target the right shoppers in the right neighborhoods. That means going beyond the DMA by creating a truly hyperlocal campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint used this data to inform several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Lawn Care Service Provider</em> &ndash; A professional lawn care service provider wanted to increase its number of qualified leads. The campaign targeted homeowners between the ages of 25 and 54 with a household income over $75,000 who also exhibited a strong interest in curb appeal. The digital campaign helped push customers to request lawn care quotes. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was 1.5 times the industry average. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Agricultural Equipment Brand</em> &ndash; A major agricultural equipment brand wanted to increase sales of its farm equipment at farm and lawn stores. We targeted neighborhoods located around the brand&rsquo;s farm and lawn equipment stores that had a high level of homeowners with considerable acreage and strong interests in gardening and home improvement. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was twice the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1]. <a href=\\"http://www.gardenresearch.com/index.php?q=show&amp;id=3636\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.gardenresearch.com/index.php?q=show&amp;id=3636</a></p>\r\n", "title"=>"Can You Dig It?

In honor of National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month, the Index looked at consumer interest and purchase data related to asthma and allergies. New York ranked the highest of all U.S. cities, and its Bay Shore and Smithtown neighborhoods were most interested in purchasing brand name and generic drugs, respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities that showed the greatest interest in asthma and allergy remedies include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Columbus, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Casper-Riverton, WY</li>\r\n\t<li>Charlotte, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Hartford and New Haven, CT</li>\r\n\t<li>Hattiesburg-Laurel, MS</li>\r\n\t<li>Lafayette, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Philadelphia, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Providence et al, RI-MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rockford, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Victoria, TX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s study drilled down into each city and found that neighborhoods differ in preference when it comes to brand name versus generic medications. For instance, those with higher education degrees (undergraduate and higher) between the ages of 25-54 are most likely to purchase brand name drugs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike traditional DMA targeting, brands and retailers can now target specific neighborhoods within the same DMA. For example, brands can identify neighborhoods of consumers who prefer generic versus brand name medications and tailor their message accordingly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese insights are invaluable to retailers and brands looking to gain a better understanding of their target audience and how to target the right consumers at the right time with the right product. Due to privacy issues highly discouraging the use of cookies in the healthcare industry, this data is often difficult to determine or access. MaxPoint&rsquo;s unique technology, which is not reliant on cookies, makes this data accessible and actionable to brands and retailers without violating consumer privacy concerns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data from this index, MaxPoint implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital advertising campaigns for both pharmaceutical brands and retailers. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major pharmaceutical brand was looking to increase awareness and participation in its asthma patient program by targeting areas with a high concentration of asthma sufferers. By combining DMA and interest data, MaxPoint was able to target women age 25-54 showing an interest in asthma for themselves and their families &ndash; ultimately doubling the number of program participants.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>A major consumer packaged goods company was interested in generating awareness and driving in-store sales of its over-the-counter cold medication. As a result of a highly targeted online video campaign, the CPG company was able to reach households with adults ages 25-54, who were interested in flu and cold remedies, and purchased competitive brands and products in the past.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Pharmaceutical companies are faced with a significant challenge when it comes to identifying and marketing to consumers, due to privacy concerns,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint. &ldquo;We use an approach that is not reliant on cookies to measure the interests and purchase patterns of consumers, and help brands and retailers develop specific and targeted online advertising campaigns to drive in-store traffic. These insights into the preferences and interests of consumers offer a unique competitive edge and help these retailers and brands build more strategic campaigns targeted at the most relevant audience.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. For the May Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics including hay fever, asthma triggers, pollen forecast, allergy shots, sinusitis, allergy and sinus medication and nasal spray, among many others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint </strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands.

A new research report sponsored by&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a> reveals the changing behavior among cost-conscious grocery shoppers as they move through the path to purchase in today&rsquo;s post-recession economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Grocery Industry Pulse titled, &ldquo;Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer,&rdquo; reveals that the average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession. While spending continues to climb, nearly three in four respondents have made changes to their grocery shopping habits within the last year, becoming more cost-conscious before and during their trips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the ways cost-conscious grocery shoppers in the U.S. have changed their behavior include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopping Closer to Home and Shopping Multiple Grocery Stores</strong><br />\r\n- More than 40% of moms and those in the 25-54 age group indicate that in the past year they have started shopping multiple grocery stores to get the best prices and deals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leveraging Coupons and Sales More</strong><br />\r\n- Close to half of all respondents and 50.4% of Moms said they clip coupons and scan their loyalty cards regularly for savings.<br />\r\n- On average, 26% of respondents use some form of digital coupons. Moms are most likely to use digital coupons, with nearly a third (30.1%) using digital methods to find coupons.<br />\r\n- Three in four respondents said they are more likely to try a new product at the grocery store if they have a coupon for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Preparing Lists Before Shopping</strong><br />\r\n- Sixty-two percent (62%) of respondents regularly make lists before going grocery shopping and more than half make their list using general product categories, rather than specific brands.<br />\r\n- Three in five decide which brand to purchase while they are in the store based on price, coupons and special promotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Using More Resources Such as Digital Channels to Prepare for Shopping Trips</strong><br />\r\n- More than 90% of shoppers regularly research products online before purchasing them in-store<br />\r\n- Moms and those in the 25-54 age group are more likely than Adults 18+ to use the Internet to prepare for grocery shopping trips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Heading to Recipe-Specific Destination Sites to Prepare for Shopping</strong><br />\r\n- Moms are also the most likely group of respondents to use digital methods to find recipes when preparing for a trip to the grocery store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Due to the economy, consumers are shifting their shopping behaviors to get more for their money,&rdquo; said Dianne Kremer, Senior Analyst at BIGinsight. &ldquo;As consumers feel a pinch from rising gas and food prices, they are becoming more creative with how they spend their grocery budgets &ndash; shopping closer to home, going to multiple stores to get the best deals and looking online for coupons and offers.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Other Key Findings Include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession from $250.94 in August 2007 to $277.00 in August 2011.

That makes it less objectionable to those worried about consumer privacy issues as well as increasing its reach at the neighborhood level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;They are going after a market opportunity that is a multibillion-dollar opportunity,&rdquo; said Gus Tai of Trinity Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has invested in MaxPoint. &ldquo;&hellip; MaxPoint has cracked that code of how to do it efficiently.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint, which until now has maintained a low profile locally, ranks among the Triangle&rsquo;s fastest-growing young technology companies. It has blossomed from a half-dozen employees at the end of 2009 to 60 at the end of last year. Today it has 83 workers &ndash; more than half of whom are based in Morrisville &ndash; and new hires that are coming on board will swell its ranks to more than 90 by June 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;And we continue to hire,&rdquo; said Joe Epperson, 41, the former eBay executive who is MaxPoint&rsquo;s founder and CEO. He expects the company will have 120 employees by the end of the year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint has created the digital equivalent of ZIP codes by dividing the nation into 34,000 neighborhoods, which it calls Digital Zips. By analyzing billions of data points &ndash; including sales data from more than 80,000 brick-and-mortar stores nationwide as well as a wealth of online and social media data &ndash; it can identify neighborhoods that are fertile grounds for a particular product or service. Equally important, it can specify which retailers have stores nearby.None of the data identifies individual consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Cutting waste</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint has coupled that mother lode of data with its real-time analysis of how best to reach consumers in a particular neighborhood through online ads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;So literally, as a page on your Web browser is rendering, we are deciding whether or not to purchase that ad,&rdquo; Epperson said. &ldquo;We make about 12 billion decisions a day.&rdquo; Each automated decisions is made in between 8 and 12 milliseconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end, said Epperson, MaxPoint&rsquo;s technology can deliver ads within a particular neighborhood to 80 percent to 90 percent of the targeted consumers that are online.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint, which was founded in 2007, has reported raising $12.2 million from outside investors to date. Like many privately held companies, it&rsquo;s tight-lipped about its revenue. Epperson said the company, which only started generating revenue in 2009, has generated &ldquo;multiple tens of millions of dollars&rdquo; in sales over the past 12 months.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalifornia Olive Ranch, an olive oil company, tested MaxPoint&rsquo;s ability to deliver its ads to the consumers most likely to buy its product &ndash; educated women who live in larger cities and like to cook.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;They helped us find the websites they&rsquo;ll be on and they overlaid that with our store network, because people tend to shop at grocery stores close to home,&rdquo; said Mike Forbes, vice president of sales and marketing. &ldquo;It cuts out the waste from our (advertising) budget and makes sure we are talking to the right people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&rdquo;Sales in Boston rose 20 percent as a result, he said.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust as importantly, we actually ran a test and noticed our brand awareness and consumers&rsquo; willingness to buy us went up rather dramatically as well,&rdquo; Forbes said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Scaling up</strong><br />\r\nCalifornia Olive is working with MaxPoint as it rolls out its olive oil to markets in North Carolina.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll actually probably be seeing our ads in Raleigh,&rdquo; Forbes said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalifornia Olive Ranch is the only customer MaxPoint has publicly disclosed. But Lynn Vitello, vice president of marketing, said the company works with 10 of the nation&rsquo;s top 15 advertisers &ndash; a group that includes Proctor &amp; Gamble, AT&amp;T and General Motors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaxPoint typically charges $4 to $5 for every 1,000 online ads purchased. Monthly payments by customers range from $5,000 to more than $500,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpperson credits customer satisfaction for fueling much of the company&rsquo;s growth. Nearly four out of five first-time customers, he said, become repeat customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe company&rsquo;s biggest challenge, said Trinity Ventures&rsquo; Tai, is to maintain the quality of its hires given its rapid-fire expansion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;And scaling (up), by the way, isn&rsquo;t easy,&rdquo; Tai added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEpperson previously worked in Silicon Valley when he was at eBay, but he and his wife are from Ohio. They wanted to return to the east coast when he decided to start MaxPoint. The two locations that made the most sense were Boston and the Triangle, because both are home to workers with the necessary business intelligence and analytics skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;It came down to this very hard-core fact that after being in California seven-plus years, my wife is like, &lsquo;Boston&rsquo;s too cold,&rsquo;&rdquo; Epperson said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Epperson has been delighted with the talent MaxPoint has been able to hire here, he stressed that the company isn&rsquo;t getting them on the cheap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;We have a Silicon Valley mentality,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have compensation packages that are equivalent to Silicon Valley because the people we hire from Duke and UNC, their alternatives are Yahoo, Google.

611	102	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on Retail Info Systems News.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>March 12, 2012</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong> When retailers and brands activate advertising campaigns, they typically start at the DMA level. The goal is to blanket as many consumer outlets as possible in an effort to drive visibility for their product, service or sale. Yet, according to recent US Census data, approximately 75% of all US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of home. Are retailers and brands spending their money effectively when it comes to reaching only the neighborhoods where their precise customers live?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocalization is critical to any brand strategy. Getting to know customers in the neighborhood is important, as they will likely provide repeat business. That said, retailers should evaluate their localization efforts to determine new ways to drive foot traffic and sales at their physical stores. Currently, this is done in-store by localizing POP and other promotional materials for a particular neighborhood&rsquo;s demographic &ndash; whether it is young professionals in a city&rsquo;s financial district or a suburban neighborhood with young families. Walking into the same retailer&rsquo;s store in different neighborhoods should provide a different experience for different audiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why is this level of localized advertising not happening more outside of the store? Channels like cable and print newspapers are targeted but are often too expensive and time consuming for many small to mid-sized retailers to invest in. Yet, by reaching potential customers at the neighborhood level with digital campaigns, retailers and brands can get much more targeted and serve the right ads to the right customers at the right time. In fact, according to a recent report from comScore, digital campaigns drive a 21% percent increase in offline store sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy using a solution that analyzes billions of data points including income, point of sale data, Web searches and interest psychographics, retailers and brands can target promotions at a highly specific demographic of potential buyers. For instance, if a retailer is looking to unload excess inventory of women&rsquo;s summer clothing because it is nearing the end of the summer season, they can create a campaign targeted at homes within an eight mile radius and where there are women that fit key demographics like age, income and style interests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis strategy is also effective around the holiday season. Retailers are often focused on selling excess inventory ordered for the holidays before the New Year. Otherwise, they must heavily discount items or return them to the manufacturer. By implementing highly-localized digital campaigns, retailers and brands can create customized advertising programs that reach a very specific audience and drive in-store sales of products that may create excess inventory if not sold during a particular time frame. This approach also helps to reach the last minute shoppers who have run out of time to purchase gifts online in the final 72 hours of the holiday shopping season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile most advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive traffic to stores, highly-localized digital campaigns of any size can easily be created in a matter of hours by reusing digital assets. For instance, reusing video content created for a mass TV campaign can be very effective by simply using it for an online video advertising campaign. This also provides consistency across channels and increases the opportunity for ROI on creative teams&rsquo; investments. Video ads can also be customized with a specific store address or specific offer to leverage a local message.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn all, there are a number of ways that retailers and brands can more effectively pinpoint advertising campaigns to reach a highly-targeted audience and eliminate wasteful advertising spend.

592	93	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Chris Kozloski, Vice President of Sales,&nbsp;MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on Street Fight</em>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>April 26, 2012</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s brands are looking for innovative ways to effectively target the right consumers with their marketing messages. Traditional media such as television spots, direct mail and email are becoming less effective, especially as consumers turn to mobile and social for their media consumption. However, for every challenge there is an opportunity, and this year it&rsquo;s all about working &ldquo;local&rdquo; into your marketing strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo clarify, when we talk about local, we don&rsquo;t mean corner stores or local brands. We&rsquo;re talking about national campaigns that pinpoint consumers at the neighborhood level. Think of the millions of marketing dollars wasted each year on national campaigns that aren&rsquo;t truly for everyone. For example, a car maker wants to create targeted awareness of their brand for all of their buyers. Not everyone in the country is an intended buyer of their brand &mdash; however, they still need to target a lot of people, but need to be smart about it. Imagine a better, more efficient and more effective way to target existing and prospective customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to achieve this level of precision, companies are turning to &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions. These solutions analyze billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.&nbsp; This data can be used to score each neighborhood and determine its interests &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s neighborhoods across the country with residents most interested in a healthier lifestyle, in the market for a new car or who currently use your competitor&rsquo;s product. By analyzing these data sets, companies can look at clusters of people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases, brands will use this local approach to complement an existing campaign. Recently, a national health insurance company wanted to supplement its traditional direct mail campaign with digital advertising to increase the number of completed and approved membership applications. By using a localized approach to its digital advertising campaign, the company was able to pinpoint the neighborhoods where the most qualified members reside and market directly to this group.&nbsp; The campaign was split into two groups &ndash; the control group (direct mail only) and the target group (direct mail and digital advertising). Neighborhoods receiving both digital ads and direct mail generated 12 percent more applications than those with direct mail only. And, the applications from these same neighborhoods led to a 40 percent higher approval rate of memberships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTargeting at the neighborhood level across the entire nation helps to curb that wasteful ad spending (in the case of the insurance company, waste was cut by 75 percent). By finding a relevant audience at a national level, brands can combine reach with efficiency and serve the right ads to the right potential buyers at the exact right time to create demand for a product.&nbsp; For example, retailers have excess inventory that they need to move before being forced to mark it down, they can create campaigns that incentivize local consumers to come in and make purchases.&nbsp; The same holds true for restaurants that are charged with driving guests into their restaurants, particularly during slow times of the day or week.&nbsp; In this case, national chains can target particular neighborhoods with targeted promotions that will drive patrons across the country into their local restaurant and help build a diverse customer base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile most advertising programs require brands to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive interest in their product or services based on the time of year or a special event, highly-localized digital campaigns of any size can easily be created in a matter of hours by reusing digital assets to drive consumers into stores. For example, according to a recent RSR study on localized advertising in retail, there is an enormous opportunity to re-use video content created for a mass TV campaign by putting it directly into an online video advertising campaign.&nbsp; This also provides consistency across channels and increases the opportunity for return on the creative&rsquo;s investment.&nbsp; Video ads can also be customized with a specific store address or specific offer to leverage a local message.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy developing a highly-customized local digital advertising strategy that complements existing campaigns, retailers and brands can consistently and effectively drive sales that help to increase revenue and create a more personal relationship with customers.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Giving National Campaigns a Local Edge", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://streetfightmag.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:06:46.769948	2013-08-27 20:31:53.105365

627	110	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By: Christina Cheddar Berk<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on CNBC.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>January 19, 2012&nbsp;&ndash;</strong> Buzzword alert: multichannel is out. The word &ldquo;multichannel&rdquo; is tied to a concept of retailers operating in multiple channels &mdash; they have a store, they have a website, and they have some way for consumers to access their products on smartphones and tablets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut one message ran loud and clear at the National Retail Federation Conference in New York this week &mdash; that&rsquo;s not enough.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome used the word &ldquo;omnichannel&rdquo; to describe shoppers slipping seamlessly from store to website to mobile device. Imagine a scenario where shoppers research a product online, head to the store to buy it, but at the last minute turn to their smartphone to double-check they&rsquo;re getting the right price. That&rsquo;s happening everyday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut others say even this is a concept falling behind the times. Shoppers don&rsquo;t think about shopping a &ldquo;channel.&rdquo; They think about shopping, and if you&rsquo;re lucky they think about shopping a specific brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResearch by Cisco suggests shoppers are imagining other ways to shop across channels. For example, most seem open to using an in-store kiosk to research products and make a purchase online, or to research a product at an in-store kiosk, purchase it in the store, and have it delivered to another location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s been an interesting progression. The recession forced consumers to be thrifty, and online search and mobile devices allowed consumers to be empowered, and they&rsquo;re not likely to leave those new behaviors behind. But the technology is changing the way consumers behave and what they expect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut time and time again, conference goers mentioned the need to train retail staff to live in this world. Salespeople need both more technology at their disposal and the ability to use it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey also need to not think of a brand&rsquo;s website as a competitor. UK retailer John Lewis has an interesting way around this. The retailer credits sales made through its website to the store nearest the location where the computer that was used for the purchase is located.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other problem around all this technology is that it can be a race to the lowest price unless a retailer can stand out to consumers in terms of service, product, experience or some combination of the three.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAscena Retail Group President and CEO David Jaffe discussed how it has been redesigning the fitting room area of its Maurices stores to emphasize the social aspect of shopping. There are places for family and friends to sit and new fixtures that make the area more inviting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis also addresses another problem that is top of mind for retailers: How do you coax consumers to the store more often?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCisco&rsquo;s research suggests shoppers would prefer to shop in stores that combine physical and virtual worlds. One concept they are testing is Cisco StyleMe, an interactive way to &ldquo;try on&rdquo; clothing and accessories virtually. Shoppers stand before a mirror-like device and use their hand to swipe on new outfits and can even send them to their friends or post them to Facebook.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Cisco&rsquo;s virtual mirror was only one example of the many, many new tools being designed to make shopping more fun for consumers that were on display at NRF.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTechnology is also being used to make shopping more personalized for consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternational Business Machines released the results of a survey of 28,000 consumers, which showed shoppers actually want to receive more communication from their favorite stores, but they want to receive these messages through their choice of media and in a way that is relevant to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut retailers need to protect this information &mdash; a point that was underscored by the revelation Monday that online shoe retailer Zappos.com was the victim of a cyber attack. It was humbling for many retailers to think that if online retail giant Amazon.com which owns Zappos, is susceptible, what about them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of that sets up a pretty long &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list for 2012.

1375	167	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>By Gretchen Joyce, Chief Operating Officer, MaxPoint<br />\r\n<em>This article first appeared on MarketingProfs.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every business owner wants the same thing: to increase sales by driving greater traffic into their stores. From billboards to coupon packets, the goal is the same: more feet through the door, more sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For small and midsize businesses, in particular, the approach has been to spend significant money and time on traditional advertising campaigns (local newspaper ads, radio, direct mail, billboards, phone book ads, and maybe even TV), yet they don&#39;t always get the kind of real, measurable results they desire. But most stick to traditional approaches because digital advertising seems out of reach&mdash;too confusing and too expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason that traditional advertising channels work is that&#39;s where the eyeballs are, but those eyeballs now also belong to consumers who are not receiving circulars or, if they are, are throwing them into the recycling bin&mdash;and looking online instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small and midsize businesses (SMBs)&mdash;especially those with multiple locations&mdash;need to evaluate digital campaigns that help level the playing field so they can compete with larger retailers and restaurants with national ad budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most SMBs may not realize that it is possible&mdash;and affordable&mdash;to target relevant consumers in close proximity to their stores by using an online, neighborhood-level targeting approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some considerations for SMBs and franchisees when evaluating their online advertising strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go digital</strong><br />\r\nSmall and midsize business owners are accustomed to traditional ad campaigns, such as direct mail, which can take weeks to plan, create, and implement. Digital advertising seems scary: too fast, too expensive, and, really, just for the big guys. But that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Digital&#39;s ability to create and perfect campaigns on the fly means they can craft timely and meaningful messages for their target audience&mdash;and fix them if they aren&#39;t delivering results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, digital advertising affords the ability to repurpose existing campaign creative. For example, content from a direct mail piece can become the basis for a digital campaign&mdash;a huge saver of time and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use data for greater relevance</strong><br />\r\nRegional and multilocation businesses, such as regional restaurant chains or franchises, now have the ability to harness technology that analyzes and combines offline and online data, enabling them to learn more about their target guests. By using that data, these business owners can pinpoint the neighborhoods where potential customers are most likely to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one example, a national restaurant chain franchisee that owned more than 100 East Coast locations evaluated what is ordered throughout the day, every day, at each location. By analyzing guest traffic patterns, typical orders, etc., the restaurant was able to identify trends and serve up relevant, online advertising campaigns based on that data&mdash;specific to each location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use targeting to bring in your best customers</strong><br />\r\nTargeting across entire DMAs is not the best strategy for small and multilocation business owners. DMAs are huge, in geography, diversity, and population&mdash;and likely beyond the reach of the proprietor of a small handful of stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three-quarters of US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of consumers&#39; homes&mdash;an area smaller than any DMA. By instead targeting the most relevant consumers at the neighborhood level, businesses can serve digital ads to only the most qualified prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a grocery store with 100 locations across the country must understand the typical demographic for each store, at the neighborhood level, to truly serve targeted offerings that will drive increased sales of specific products. Those stores can now use online and offline data to pinpoint the neighborhood most interested in specific products&mdash;for example, Christmas vs. Hanukah dinner ingredients and supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Save money by eliminating wasteful ad spending</strong><br />\r\nHyperlocal, neighborhood-level digital targeting enables small and regional businesses to efficiently reach the most relevant shoppers, driving them to their local stores or restaurants for less than the cost of traditional advertising channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By targeting their ads only to those neighborhoods that have residents most interested in their products, businesses can eliminate the cost of advertising to irrelevant audiences that are going to ignore their messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grow your business</strong><br />\r\nUnlike any other medium, digital advertising drives qualified shoppers into your stores&mdash;new local shoppers, valuable &quot;hand raisers&quot; who have visited your website, as well as past and current customers. In addition, digital advertising enables businesses to scale campaigns at a pace that fits their business needs&mdash;as quickly or slowly as necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now is the time to consider hyperlocal digital strategies to fulfill specific revenue goals for your small and midsize business, whether you have multiple locations across the country or just a few regionally or locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harnessing online and offline data puts small business owners in the driver&#39;s seat&mdash;pushing sales to locations that need it most and easing the time, money, and resources demanded of you when employing traditional advertising techniques.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Hyperlocal Advertising Strategies for SMBs", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>""	\N	2013-08-29 22:18:43.643222	2013-08-29 22:21:01.041583

As more and more people are headed online, it has become clear that there are new channels for retailers to leverage when it comes to executing highly deliverable ad campaigns. Traditional advertising methods alone cannot deliver maximum reach, so marketers are exploring new advertising channels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, more ad dollars are being allocated to digital and advertisers are working with retailers to develop campaigns that can be executed across all channels. Creating &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; campaigns can be difficult, however, when it comes to buying different types of media and integrating them into a single plan. From campaign creation to optimization and reporting, working across multiple platforms takes a great understanding of how to properly execute a campaign on every level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the recent ad:tech event held in San Francisco, there was a lot of discussion around the growth the digital advertising industry has seen and the challenges advertisers run into when executing &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; campaigns. A few of these challenges include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReducing complexity.&nbsp;When it comes to buying different types of media, there&rsquo;s a concern for reducing the complexity of digital advertising and moving towards transparency between publishers and advertisers &ndash; knowing exactly what you are paying for.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEffective targeting.&nbsp;There is a struggle to effectively deliver an advertisement to a relevant audience. In order to achieve maximum ROI, retailers need to effectively reach consumers that fit their shopper profile. It will not matter if your advertisement reaches a large audience if they are not the right audience to receive your messaging. Fortunately, today, localized targeting ad solutions allow you to apply high accuracy targeting &ndash; getting local reach while maintaining national scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite these challenges, the opportunities digital advertising vehicles provide can demonstrate a strong return on investment. It has been and continues to be a great complement to traditional advertising methods. Data-centric planning paired with strong ad elements and DMA specific messaging/targeting are all components of a strong advertising campaign. Leverage current creative used for traditional channels for pre/mid-roll video ads on digital channels to reach a whole new audience and create a strong marketing mix.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Creating “Cross-Platform” Campaigns: What Works, What to Avoid", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.imediaconnection.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:05:40.128839	2013-08-27 20:20:15.261147

A new <a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/GroceryShopperInsights?campaign_id=70130000001rlQF&amp;source=pressrelease\\" target=\\"_blank\\">research report</a> sponsored by MaxPoint reveals the changing behavior among cost-conscious grocery shoppers as they move through the path to purchase in today&rsquo;s post-recession economy. &ldquo;Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer&rdquo; reveals that the average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession. While spending continues to climb, nearly three in four respondents have made changes to their grocery shopping habits within the last year, becoming more cost-conscious before and during their trips. Some of the ways cost-conscious grocery shoppers in the U.S. have changed their behavior include the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Shopping Closer to Home and Shopping Multiple Grocery Stores</strong><br />\r\nMore than 40 percent of moms and those age 25-54 indicate that in the past year they have started shopping multiple grocery stores to get the best prices and deals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leveraging Coupons and Sales More</strong><br />\r\nClose to half of all respondents and 50.4 percent of Moms said they clip coupons and scan their loyalty cards regularly for savings. On average, 26 percent of respondents use some form of digital coupons. Moms are most likely to use digital coupons, with nearly a third using digital methods to find coupons. Three in four respondents said they are more likely to try a new product at the grocery store if they have a coupon for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Preparing Lists Before Shopping</strong><br />\r\nSixty-two percent of respondents regularly make lists before going grocery shopping and more than half make their list using general product categories, rather than specific brands. Three in five decide which brand to purchase while they are in the store based on price, coupons and special promotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Using More Resources Such as Digital Channels to Prepare for Shopping Trips</strong><br />\r\nMore than 90 percent of shoppers regularly research products online before purchasing them in-store. Moms and those age 25-54 are more likely than adults 18 and over to use the Internet to prepare for grocery shopping trips.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Heading to Recipe-Specific Destination Sites to Prepare for Shopping</strong><br />\r\nMoms are also the most likely group of respondents to use digital methods to find recipes when preparing for a trip to the grocery store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Due to the economy, consumers are shifting their shopping behaviors to get more for their money,&rdquo; said Dianne Kremer, senior analyst at BIGinsight. &ldquo;As consumers feel a pinch from rising gas and food prices, they are becoming more creative with how they spend their grocery budgets &ndash; shopping closer to home, going to multiple stores to get the best deals and looking online for coupons and offers.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther key findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession from $250.94 in August 2007 to $277 in August 2011. Among moms, it has steadily increased from $311.95 to $341.14 during the same timeframe.</li>\r\n\t<li>Two in five respondents indicate they are purchasing more store brand or generic items now than compared with this time last year; 53.4 percent are purchasing the same amount.</li>\r\n\t<li>Three in 10 respondents have cut back on purchasing bakery items, candy, dessert items and magazines/books/DVDs over the past year. One in four have cut back on prime cuts of meat and seafood.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Digital is reshaping the grocery shopping experience in the post-recession economy, as consumers turn to new channels to help plan their shopping trips,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, MaxPoint COO. &ldquo;By understanding what motivates today&rsquo;s consumer, brands can tailor their shopper marketing strategies to ensure they are gaining mindshare and winning at the shelf-level.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint&rsquo;s</a> retail advertising platform helps to drive in-store traffic for retailers and brands.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How Today’s Cost-Conscious Grocery Shoppers Tick", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.progressivegrocer.com/"	\N	2013-05-16 19:05:05.248019	2013-08-27 20:19:43.665915

As families get ready for their vacations&mdash;to the beach, the mountains, or the theme park&mdash;many will need to pick up new cars to accommodate their children. As a result, now is the time for automotive advertisers to prepare to capitalize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most auto customers use digital tools to research their new vehicles, and auto companies are leveraging this. According to a recent IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report, Internet advertising revenues for the automotive space reached over $4 billion in 2012.[1] This makes it clear that digital is becoming an important channel for automotive advertising.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that SUVs and minivans make excellent family vehicles. According to the NADA, the top purchases for minivans in 2012 included the Dodge Caravan, Honda Odyssey, Chrysler Town and Country, Toyota Sienna, and Kia Sedona. The top purchases for SUVs in 2012 included the Honda CRV, Ford Escape, Chevrolet Equinox, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Explorer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s not as easy to find information on which types of families prefer SUVs and which prefer minivans. To help auto advertisers better tailor their advertising efforts, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip&reg; technology to develop a clear profile of both niche audiences. As an outcome of the research, we found that the key difference between the two audiences lies primarily in their interests. Additionally, we located the top cities in the nation that included neighborhoods with high concentrations of each group. This article presents MaxPoint&rsquo;s findings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Minivan Families Profile</em><br />\r\nBased on our research, we found that minivan families tend to have the following characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re typically between the ages of 35 and 55.</li>\r\n\t<li>Their incomes exceed $100,000 per year.</li>\r\n\t<li>They usually have college degrees. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing MaxPoint&rsquo;s interest data, we found that this audience is interested in new technology, business and finance, the economy, sports, eco-friendly living, and home improvement. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>SUV Families Profile</em><br />\r\nDemographically, the SUV family audience shares a lot in common with the minivan audience. In particular:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re usually over 45 years old.</li>\r\n\t<li>They have an income of $100,000 per year or more.</li>\r\n\t<li>They have college degrees.</li>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re homeowners.</li>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re most likely married. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhile the demographics for this group resemble the demographics for minivan families, the audience diverges on its key interests. MaxPoint found that this audience is interested in general sports and extreme sports, food and drink trends, golf, and running; although, SUV families also share a love of technology with their minivan family counterparts. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Where to Find Them</strong><br />\r\nOf course, there are minivan owners and SUV owners in every city. However, a few cities have more neighborhoods with high concentrations of minivan owners and SUV families than others.

Within Raleigh, NC, we found that the highest indexing neighborhoods for minivan ownership included Downing Village, Waterford Estates, Kitts Creek, Breckenridge, Chessington, and Huntington Woods. For the SUV crowd, MaxPoint looked at several neighborhoods in Denver, CO, and found that the top neighborhoods were Soda Creek, Kerr Gulch, Tanoa, the Ridge at Hiwan, the Overlook, and Troutdale Village. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nMany auto advertisers only look at demographics. But, as MaxPoint&rsquo;s research shows, there&rsquo;s much more to the story. In fact, the key difference between the two groups lies in their interests&mdash;what do they spend their time reading about and thinking about? To target the right customers, advertisers need to deliver ads to neighborhoods where specific interests are high&mdash;for example, when running an ad campaign for SUVs, the auto company should target families with an interest in extreme sports. Additionally, advertisers may want to break up their creative efforts by neighborhood&mdash;with minivan ads in one location and SUV ads in another. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end, the best approach for an automotive advertiser is to focus on both the profile and the location. This involves running a hyperlocal campaign that uses data from multiple offline and online sources to truly target the perfect customers. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong> &nbsp;<br />\r\nMaxPoint used this data to bolster the results of several digital advertising campaigns, including: &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>National Luxury Automobile Brand&mdash;</strong>A luxury automobile brand sought to drive customers to campaign pages on its website. MaxPoint targeted people between the ages of 25 and 54 with a household income over $100,000 that lived within 25 miles of dealership locations. MaxPoint also found that the best audience to target was interested in beauty, new technology, yoga, business and finance, and sports. The campaign helped the auto brand sell cars in multiple markets from the same campaign. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Regional Auto Group&mdash;</strong>A regional automotive group wanted to advertise its cars in several areas using video pre-roll advertisements. MaxPoint was able to help the automotive advertisers target families with children under 18. Early campaign results have been extremely positive, showing a drastic increase in responsiveness over the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <a href=\\"http://www.iab.net/insights_research/industry_data_and_landscape/adrevenuereport\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>http://www.iab.net/insights_research/industry_data_and_landscape/adrevenuereport</u></a></p>\r\n", "title"=>"Are We There Yet?

By analyzing billions of purchases and online data points, MaxPoint identified two distinct groups and where they live: families most likely to buy an SUV and families most likely to buy a minivan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a recent IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report, Internet advertising revenues for the automotive space reached more than $4 billion in 2012.[1] Digital is increasingly becoming a more important channel for automotive advertising, and no longer can advertisers rely solely on demographic information to target potential SUV or minivan buyers at the hyperlocal level. To help auto advertisers better tailor their advertising efforts, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip technology to develop a clear profile of both niche audiences. The research found that the key difference between the two audiences lies primarily in their interests. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Profile of a Minivan Family</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint found that minivan families are typically between the ages of 35 and 55, hold a college degree and have incomes that exceed $100,000 a year. They trend high on interest in topics such as new technology, business and finance, the economy, sports, eco-friendly living and home improvement. The U.S. cities with a high concentration of minivan families are: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cleveland, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Des Moines, IA</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Orlando, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;Philadelphia, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Raleigh, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Seattle, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Springfield, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Toledo, OH <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The Profile of an SUV Family </strong><br />\r\nLike their minivan family counterparts, the SUV families usually have an income of $100,000 or more per year and hold college degrees. However, SUV buyers are normally older than 45, are married and own a home. They trend high on interest in topics such as extreme sports, food and drink trends, golf and running. The U.S. cities with a high concentration of SUV families are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Albuquerque, NM</li>\r\n\t<li>Anchorage, AK</li>\r\n\t<li>Atlanta, GA</li>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Chicago, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n\t<li>Houston, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Sacramento, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint found that, even within the top cities, certain neighborhoods indexed higher than others for minivan or SUV ownership. For instance, within Raleigh, NC, the company found that the highest indexing neighborhoods for minivan ownership included Downing Village, Waterford Estates, Kitts Creek, Breckenridge, Chessington, and Huntington Woods.

MaxPoint was able to help the automotive advertiser target families with children under 18. Early campaign results have been extremely positive, showing a drastic increase in responsiveness over the industry average. <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a> technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.

1446	176	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>People care deeply about their homes, and they spend accordingly. A 2013 J.D. Power report found that customers spend an average of $1,626 per year on home improvement.<a href=\\"#_edn1\\" name=\\"_ednref1\\" title=\\"\\">[i]</a> That means that for every new customer a home improvement retailer gains, there&rsquo;s significant opportunity for sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help home improvement advertisers target customers more effectively, MaxPoint used its proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to discover the most lucrative markets for this category. In the process, we discovered two distinct types of customers&mdash;renovators and decorators. The following report shares our findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Cities for Home Improvement</strong><br />\r\nWe started by identifying the cities with the top neighborhoods for home improvers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Cheyenne, WY</li>\r\n\t<li>Austin, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Santa Barbara, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n\t<li>Casper, WY</li>\r\n\t<li>Rapid City, SD</li>\r\n\t<li>Reno, NV</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEach city on this list includes neighborhoods with households that spend far more than the national average on home improvement. Because of this, advertisers often see the biggest returns on their digital home improvement campaigns in these markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two Key Profiles: Renovators and Decorators</strong><br />\r\nNot all home improvers are the same&mdash;some tend to purchase hardware and construction supplies, while others spend their cash on furnishings and decorations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renovators, for example, spend their money at home improvement and hardware stores, which frequently stock tools, paint, and plumbing supplies. The renovators tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be 45&ndash;64 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Make more than $60,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college degrees</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Have kids currently living in their households</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing our proprietary interest data, we found that renovators commonly consume content on business and finance, elderly care, and fashion. Their other major purchases include financial services and insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, decorators spend more of their money on beautifying their homes and at home furnishing stores, which frequently sell furniture, home d&eacute;cor, and bedding. The decorators tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be more than 45 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Make more than $100,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college degrees</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint found that the decorators are also interested in content on the economy, golf, and sports. These shoppers frequently purchase products at shoe stores and specialty apparel stores (often high-end boutiques).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These groups had a lot in common as well. We found that both groups tend to purchase goods at general merchandise stores, consumer electronics and appliances stores, department stores, family apparel stores, music and video stores, and sporting goods stores. Additionally, their ages, education levels, and home ownership levels were similar. However, key differences remain in their interests, income level, and some of their other purchases. This demonstrates the importance of going beyond demographic data to find and target your ideal shoppers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Closer Look at Dallas</strong><br />\r\nKnowing who your customers are&mdash;whether they are renovators or decorators&mdash;is just as important as knowing where to find them. To prove that point, we zoomed in on Dallas to find the top neighborhoods for each type of home improver. Not surprisingly, renovators and decorators can be found in different Dallas-area neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renovators live in the following neighborhoods:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Casa View Heights</li>\r\n\t<li>Country Forest</li>\r\n\t<li>Lake Park Estates</li>\r\n\t<li>Moss Meadows</li>\r\n\t<li>Whispering Hills</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut when it comes to decorators, the following neighborhoods top the charts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Devonshire</li>\r\n\t<li>Junius Heights</li>\r\n\t<li>Oak Lawn</li>\r\n\t<li>Ridgewood Park</li>\r\n\t<li>White Rock Valley</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMany of these neighborhoods are close together, which further underscores the importance of targeting at the precise neighborhood level rather than running ads in broad geographic regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nArmed with this information, home improvement advertisers can make more informed ad buys and placements. By targeting either renovator or decorator neighborhoods, advertisers can maximize their responses while reducing their overall ad waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a retailer that sells bedding should focus its ad buys on decorators. If the retailer targets Dallas, it should advertise to residents of Oak Lawn, Devonshire, and White Rock Valley, while skipping the neighborhoods on the renovator list. This neighborhood-level targeting will keep responses high and ad waste low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns for companies targeting renovators or decorators:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Carpet Tile Retailer</strong>&mdash;A carpet tile retailer wanted to boost sales by driving more customers to its physical stores. To help, MaxPoint targeted households located around the retailer that included shoppers aged 25&ndash;54 with household incomes above $100,000 per year and strong interest in home d&eacute;cor. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was 22% above the industry average.<a href=\\"#_edn2\\" name=\\"_ednref2\\" title=\\"\\">[ii]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>North American Home Improvement Retailer</strong>&mdash;A major home improvement retailer wanted to build awareness of its products and drive more foot traffic through its doors. The retailer decided to run different advertisements to DIYers and decorators depending on the season, and targeted adults ages 45&ndash;64.

545	70	\N	2	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, NC &ndash; December 14, 2012 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;As the holidays approach,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, today revealed the results of its second annual Holiday Cheer Interest Index. By identifying the top 10 most festive cities in the U.S., MaxPoint is helping retailers and brands create targeted, hyperlocal holiday advertising campaigns. This year, Salt Lake City dethroned&nbsp;2011&rsquo;s &ldquo;cheeriest&rdquo; city, Eau Claire, Wis., moving up from its 2011 sixth-place position. According to the National Retail Federation, spending for holiday d&eacute;cor alone this year will reach $6.9 billion &ndash; making these cities and their respective neighborhoods incredibly valuable to advertisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Top 10 Cities with the Most Holiday Cheer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n\t<li>Eau Claire, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Portland, ME</li>\r\n\t<li>Omaha, NE</li>\r\n\t<li>Evansville, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Traverse City, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Buffalo, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Boise, ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Wilmington, NC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo identify the top 10, MaxPoint analyzed billions of offline and online data points and scored cities on a variety of holiday interests including holiday d&eacute;cor, holiday recipes, classic holiday movies, the perfect Christmas gifts, etc. Based on point-of-sale data and consumption of social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines, MaxPoint located the specific neighborhoods that have the most holiday spirit, an important distinction for retailers and brands looking to drive local in-store traffic. For example, within Salt Lake City there are pockets of shoppers who have even more holiday cheer than their fellow city residents &ndash; these shoppers live in Carriage Chase, Hidden Valley and River Oaks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>&ldquo;Cheeriest&rdquo; Shopper Profiles</strong><br />\r\nAcross all 10 cities, the individuals with the most holiday cheer showed many similarities. A majority of the spirited shoppers are 55 years or older, married and owners of their homes. These consumers tend to earn a household income of more than $100,000, contributing to their ability to make purchases this holiday season. Retailers and brands can reach these shoppers with highly targeted campaigns appealing to both their specific demographics and interests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interest Index Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data pulled from the Holiday Cheer Interest Index, MaxPoint ran several successful digital advertising campaigns:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For a diaper brand with a holiday-themed line, MaxPoint implemented a digital advertising campaign targeting mothers who have young children and who are most interested in purchasing holiday products. By analyzing data on the neighborhood level and combining this with interest data, the brand was able to drive in-store traffic to specific retail locations carrying the holiday diapers.</li>\r\n\t<li>For a well-known juice brand, MaxPoint implemented a digital advertising campaign promoting a seasonal, alcohol-free alternative to wine and champagne. By finding the shoppers most interested in holiday products within a certain radius of store locations, the beverage company was able to significantly raise its awareness among consumers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Holiday spending is in full swing and with a limited number of consumer dollars left on the table, retailers and brands are putting an enormous amount of resources toward their holiday advertising campaigns,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint. &ldquo;Now more than ever, it is crucial for retailers and brands to understand not only who the most qualified holiday shoppers are but also where they can be found. By combining this data effectively, we can help retailers and brands take advantage of the lucrative holiday season by cutting through the clutter with a hyper-targeted message that inspires in-store shopping.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><u>Digital Zip</u></a>&nbsp;technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as: offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. For its second annual Holiday Cheer Interest Index, the company scored each neighborhood across hundreds of online topics related to consumers interested in holiday d&eacute;cor, holiday recipes, classic holiday movies, the perfect Christmas gifts, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers, brands, and multi-location business owners.

Rather than blanketing an area with a campaign and hoping it sticks, we&rsquo;re able to direct them to the neighborhoods where they will get the biggest return on their advertising investment in the shortest amount of time.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to iSuppli, tablets will be the fourth-largest semiconductor market by 2014. Tablets were 35th in the market in 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The speed of the media tablet&rsquo;s rise from near insignificance to top-tier prominence is unprecedented in the history of the global semiconductor industry,&rdquo; said Dale Ford, head of electronics &amp; semiconductor research for IHS. &ldquo;Driven primarily by Apple&rsquo;s iPad, the media tablet in four years is expected to scale semiconductor heights that took more than a decade for other products to attain, such as notebook PCs and cellphones. This meteoric ascension will have major repercussions for the global semiconductor industry, as it realigns to accommodate the fast growth and vast size of the media tablet market.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich brings us to mobile applications and web options for brands. The rapid growth in mobile has businesses looking for more functionality in the mobile space. A leader in mobile and online presentations, Brainshark, has upgraded their SlideShark app, which allows salespeople to use and view online presentations on-demand. Through the app users can share presentations, track how presentations are shared/viewed and even delete files from their online account from the iPad, freeing up additional storage space as needed.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How mobile is pushing digital growth ", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.bizreport.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 00:15:04.186246	2013-08-27 20:30:20.944331

A new research report sponsored by&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a> reveals the changing behavior among cost-conscious grocery shoppers as they move through the path to purchase in today&rsquo;s post-recession economy.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer&rdquo; reveals that the average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession.

Shoppers also leverage sales and coupons more, with close to half of all respondents and just over 50% of moms saying they clip coupons and scan loyalty cards for savings.&ldquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the economy, consumers are shifting their shopping behaviors to get more for their money,&rdquo; said Dianne Kremer, senior analyst at BIGinsight, in Progressive Grocer. &ldquo;As consumers feel a pinch from rising gas and food prices, they are becoming more creative with how they spend their grocery budgets &ndash; shopping closer to home, going to multiple stores to get the best deals and looking online for coupons and offers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n", "title"=>"How Cost-Conscious Grocery Shoppers Tick", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.nacsonline.com/Pages/default.aspx"	\N	2013-05-15 03:30:40.153123	2013-08-27 20:18:39.289277

Most likely, the shoppers that are cutting back are waiting to buy seafood and meat until there is a good deal,&rdquo; said Dianne Kramer, senior analyst for BIGInsights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, consumers&rsquo; average monthly spend on groceries rose from USD 250.94 in August 2007 to USD 277 in August 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCutting back on indulgent purchases is just one of the many changes consumers have made over the past year. More than 40 percent of moms and consumers aged 25 to 54 said they began shopping multiple grocery stores in the past year in order to find the best prices and deals. More shoppers said they are shopping at discount retailers, including Walmart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn impressive 38.7 percent of consumers say they are purchasing more store brand products this year, compared to last year. Even though shoppers are watching their grocery budgets much more closely, many are still buying organic products. More than 36 percent said they are purchasing the same amount of organic products this year, while 12.9 percent said they are purchasing more and 14.1 percent said they are purchasing fewer products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsumers are also planning ahead more and making fewer impulse purchases. More than 62 percent regularly make lists before going grocery shopping. Three out of every five shoppers decide which brand to purchase while they are in the store, based on price, coupons and special promotions.</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Americans still cutting back on luxury buys", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_name"=>NULL, "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://www.seafoodsource.com/"	\N	2013-05-15 03:29:35.836362	2013-08-27 20:02:12.742333

1560	185	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>It&rsquo;s the holiday shopping season&mdash;that time of year when people pick out the perfect presents for their loved ones and retailers roll out deals to entice shoppers to grab more products off the shelves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the National Retail Federation, the average consumer will spend $738 on gifts and other seasonal items this year.<a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> The same report also hints at the holiday purchaser&rsquo;s mindset&mdash;with 64.7% planning to purchase from discount stores and 35.6% claiming they often decide on a retailer by the deals that it offers.<a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> In other words, shoppers will likely seek out bargains this year, just as they did last year. (You can learn more about the top cost-conscious holiday buyers by reading <a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/us/advertising-tips-and-strategies/advertising-insights/looking-for-holiday-bargains\\" target=\\"_blank\\">our bargain-seeker holiday shopper Index</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help advertisers reach shoppers buying gifts for children this holiday season, we looked at the top areas in the nation for toy purchases. Using our proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, we located the cities and neighborhoods these shoppers live in, and we gained key insights into their demographics, interests, and purchases. The following report shares our findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Toy Purchasing Areas</strong><br />\r\nWe began by using purchase data to find the cities with the highest rates of toy purchases. The top cities are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Each city on this list has higher levels of toy purchases than most others in the nation. Their residents purchase all types of toys&mdash;from discount teddy bears to high-end electronics. However, it pays to get more specific. In fact, the best way to really make sure you spend efficiently is to use a hyperlocal neighborhood-level approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, within Phoenix, the neighborhoods of Sun City West, Taliesin West, and Tremaine purchase more luxury and big ticket toys than other neighborhoods. On the other hand, for the retailer that sells bargain toys in Phoenix, Alhambra, East Side, and Wittman are more likely to purchase discounted gifts. Even though toy retailers could target the entire Phoenix DMA, they&rsquo;ll get higher responses (and more sales) with the same budgets by focusing on only those neighborhoods most likely to purchase luxury or bargain toys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Profiles of Toy Shoppers&mdash;Luxury and Bargain Toy Buyers</strong><br />\r\nYou probably already have a good image in mind of the typical toy shopper. However, when you look at the data, you might be surprised to find new insights that can deepen your current understanding of your audience. To help with that, we examined two types of toy purchasers&mdash;luxury toy buyers and bargain toy buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bargain toy buyers tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have incomes above $40,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Be between 18 and 35 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Have high school educations or higher</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdditionally, their key interests include crafts, home improvement, fitness, retirement planning, and gardening. Using our purchase data, we discovered that these shoppers also spend much of their money at office supply chains, automotive retail stores, home furnishings stores, discount department stores, sporting goods stores, and general merchandise stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum are luxury toy buyers, who:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have incomes above $80,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Are between 55 and 65 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college degrees or higher</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis group&rsquo;s key interests include beauty, food and drink trends, business and finance, and the economy. In addition to luxury toys, the group also frequents women&rsquo;s apparel stores, department stores, consumer electronics stores, and family apparel stores. In addition to in-store product purchases, the group spends heavily on insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nAdvertisers can use the findings from this Index to inform their strategies for selling toys this holiday season. For example, toy manufacturers might decide to advertise big ticket toys to neighborhoods filled with luxury toy buyers, while advertising lower-priced toys to budget toy buyer neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, they could use the interest and purchase data to develop their advertisements by including imagery that appeals to each group. For example, advertisers could focus on sports-related imagery and toys for the budget group, and they could focus on electronics for the luxury group that spends more on electronics purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The holiday season carries a large piece of the yearly sales pie for retailers. For retailers that want people unwrapping their toys this holiday season, the best strategy is to take a data-based hyperlocal digital advertising approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint has run digital campaigns for toy retailers trying to cash in on the holiday season. One example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>World Leading Toy Retailer</strong><em>&mdash;</em>The world&rsquo;s leading toy and juvenile products retailer approached MaxPoint to drive awareness of its layaway program and coupon downloads.

1307	158	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C. &ndash; July 30, 2013 &ndash;</strong> Summer is prime time for entertainment, and whether its movies, concert tickets or music, consumers are spending money to be entertained. A new Index from <a href=\\"http://www.maxpoint.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive in-store sales with its innovative Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, has identified the top cities with neighborhoods that over-index for consumer entertainment spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite slowed economic times, the entertainment industry in the U.S. continues to be lucrative. According to the MPAA Theatrical Market Statistics, in 2012, more than 225 million people went to the movies at least once, and music sales topped more than $7.1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Areas of U.S. Consumer Entertainment Spend</strong><br />\r\nUsing its proprietary Digital Zip technology, MaxPoint was able to pinpoint the top neighborhoods in the country where consumer spending on entertainment is higher than the national average. The company analyzed billions of offline and online data points, including credit card transaction data, to track purchases such as DVDs, music and online videos and concert data, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following cities have neighborhoods that scored the highest when it comes to consumer entertainment spend:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Chattanooga, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Detroit, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The Profile of an Entertainment Spender</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint looked into neighborhoods in two of the cities on the list, Detroit and New York City, to determine the neighborhoods within these cities that trend the highest on entertainment spending. MaxPoint also developed a profile of the neighborhood residents, including their demographics and interests. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within Detroit, the top neighborhoods were: Bloomfield Hills, Birmingham, Franklin, Lake Orion Heights, Orchard Lake and Troy. MaxPoint found that the spenders in these neighborhoods typically make $100,000 a year, own their homes and have college degrees. They trend high on interest in topics such as the economy, law, the government, sports and yoga.&nbsp; Typically, their purchases are focused in the following categories: cell phone services, department stores, insurance, mass grocery stores and women&rsquo;s apparel stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In New York City, Greenwich Village, Nolita, SoHo and the West Village are the neighborhoods that spend the most on consumer entertainment. Consumers in these neighborhoods tend to be between the ages of 35-54, have college degrees and have incomes of more than $100,000 per year. These consumers tend to spend a lot of time online reading content about business, finance, the economy, food and drink trends and sports. Based on MaxPoint&rsquo;s analysis of credit card spending patterns in these neighborhoods, they spend the most in the following categories: children&rsquo;s apparel stores, department stores, family apparel stores, shoe stores and women&rsquo;s apparel stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using MaxPoint&rsquo;s ability to cull information from multiple offline and online data sources (analyzing more than a petabyte worth of data each day), entertainment advertisers can pinpoint qualified customers at scale and reach enough of them to boost their ticket sales, DVD sales or attendance at concerts, sporting events or amusement parks. And, by focusing on only the most relevant neighborhoods, the advertisers keep their costs down and their ad spend efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Entertainment continues to be one of the biggest categories in terms of where consumers spend their disposable income,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO of MaxPoint. &ldquo;The key is to look at both purchase data and interest data so that advertisers have a better guide to spend their budgets on only the most responsive neighborhoods. When armed with this information, they are able to more effectively reach mass quantities of the right consumers with their messages and offers, and ultimately drive more store traffic, event attendance and sales.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint used its Digital Zip technology to run hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns for several entertainment-related companies&rsquo; campaigns, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major hotel venue that wanted to sell tickets for a concert that would take place in the hotel. To help them, MaxPoint targeted neighborhoods, in and near the city, with residents who had spent money at the hotel, made more than $70,000 per year and had high purchases in the entertainment category. As a result, the campaign resulted in a click-through rate (CTR) of more than double the industry average.</li>\r\n\t<li>A national entertainment chain that wanted to drive foot traffic to its locations via several promotional coupons for its grand re-opening. To help them, MaxPoint targeted neighborhoods within a tight radius of the stores that over-indexed for adults, aged 25&ndash;45, with interests in gaming and entertainment purchases. The campaign produced a CTR that was four times the industry average.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/solution/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a> technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as offline point-of-sale data, credit card purchase data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About MaxPoint </strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands. The company&rsquo;s Digital Zip<sup><sub>&reg;</sub></sup> technology delivers the most effective and scalable hyperlocal neighborhood-level online campaigns.

1416	171	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>A list of the most fashionable cities across the world reads like a dream itinerary for the international jetsetter: New York, Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Tokyo, London, and Hong Kong, among others, all make the list. These major fashion hubs boast stylish residents, boutiques from the top designers, budding new talent, and economies that depend, in part, on the production and sale of trendy garments and luxury accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\\"margin-left:80px\\"><strong>sartorial</strong><br />\r\nA popular fashion term since the launch of <em>The Sartorialist</em>&mdash;a style<br />\r\nblog created by photographer Scott Schuman&mdash;<em>sartorial </em>means<br />\r\n&ldquo;of or relating to a tailor or tailored clothes; of or relating to clothes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, New York City residents in particular demonstrate a higher-than-average interest in fashion, which they satisfy by consuming industry-related content online and by making stylish purchases in stores. This elevated interest makes New York an ideal place for US advertisers to run online ads that drive the fashion-conscious into local stores, where they may buy anything from reasonably priced outfits for the office, to their first investment piece from the handbag department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fashionable New York Neighborhoods</strong><br />\r\nWithin stylish New York, there are specific neighborhoods where an interest in fashion is even more dominant than it is in neighboring communities. In preparation for New York&rsquo;s most important February fashion event&mdash;Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week&mdash;we took the opportunity to analyze billions of online data points to find these pockets of very fashionable residents. Nine neighborhoods make up the list:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Astoria</li>\r\n\t<li>Central Park South</li>\r\n\t<li>Chelsea</li>\r\n\t<li>Gramercy-Flatiron</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenwich Village</li>\r\n\t<li>Sunnyside</li>\r\n\t<li>West SoHo</li>\r\n\t<li>White Plains</li>\r\n\t<li>Williamsburg</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Shopper Profile</strong><br />\r\nFashionable shoppers in the top neighborhoods share a few things in common:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re between 35 and 44 years of age.</li>\r\n\t<li>They&rsquo;re single.</li>\r\n\t<li>They make between $40,000 and $80,000 per year.</li>\r\n\t<li>They search for the latest content online related to Fashion Week, designer handbags, and the top designers.</li>\r\n\t<li>They frequent websites for the world&rsquo;s top fashion magazines (including <em>Vogue </em>and <em>W </em>magazine), as well as fashion blogs.</li>\r\n\t<li>They are also interested in interior design, arts and culture, gourmet food, yoga, beauty, weddings, and running.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn many ways, this shopper profile offers interesting insights that contradict the assumptions many advertisers have made in the past about the fashion-conscious. For example, the most fashionable shoppers are not in their 20s. Instead, they&rsquo;re in their late 30s and early 40s, perhaps having had more time to absorb the fashion scene and to cultivate an interest in all things stylish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of New York&rsquo;s fashionable shoppers also don&rsquo;t make enough to purchase runway designs. This piece of information is extremely valuable to advertisers. Take Michael Kors, for example. Although Kors is a steady fixture on the runway, he&rsquo;s also taken great lengths to capitalize on the &ldquo;affordable luxury&rdquo; trend. In 2004, Kors launched his MICHAEL Michael Kors line, which features dresses priced between $99 and $300 (compared to the $1,000 to $3,000 price tags for the pieces at the top of his collection).<a href=\\"#_edn1\\" name=\\"_ednref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> The decisions he&rsquo;s made about his line have put him in a strong position to drive in-store sales from New York fashionistas via targeted online ads showcasing sophisticated yet affordable designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion designers aren&rsquo;t the only advertisers who can use our shopper insights to their advantage. Department stores can also capitalize on New York&rsquo;s interested but financially grounded fashion audience: trunk shows that offer a modest discount on current trends, semi-annual sales, and affordable versions of red-carpet looks are just some of the attractive promotions advertisers can feature in online ads to drive purchase-ready New York shoppers to their stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nNew York City&rsquo;s fashion retail market is the nation&rsquo;s largest, generating more than $15 billion in sales each year.<a href=\\"#_edn2\\" name=\\"_ednref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> Designers, boutiques, department stores, and other fashion retailers stand to make a fairly substantial profit from online ads that drive New York&rsquo;s most fashionable residents into stores. By targeting online ads to the city&rsquo;s most stylish neighborhoods and tailoring ad content so that it speaks to an audience with clearly defined demographics, online activity, and interests, digital advertisers will make the most of their hyperlocal online fashion campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data from this Interest Index, we ran several digital advertising campaigns, including the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leading Department Store </strong>&ndash; A high-end department store sought to increase consumer awareness and education of its products and services. MaxPoint helped the company launch a multiple-month campaign targeting women 25 to 44 years of age with an income of $50,000+ who also exhibited a strong interest in fashion, shopping, and style. The campaign resulted in a click-through rate that was three times the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>British Fashion Designer </strong>&ndash; A British fashion designer with store locations in the United States wanted to drive qualified customers to its website and to gain insights about who was responding to its ads. MaxPoint targeted adults living within 8 to 10 miles of the designer&rsquo;s US locations with hyperlocal digital ads. The ads resulted in more than 2,000 visits to the designer&rsquo;s website and provided insights into the respondents&rsquo; age, education, household income, and net worth. These insights provided the foundation for future targeted campaigns.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref1\\" name=\\"_edn1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> <a href=\\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/13/news/companies/michael_kors_fashion.fortune/index.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/13/news/companies/michael_kors_fashion.fortune/index.htm</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ednref2\\" name=\\"_edn2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> New York City Economic Development Corporation, <em>Fashion.NYC.2020</em>, 2012</p>\r\n", "title"=>"Sartorial New York", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/09/05/10_05_13_29_Sartorial_New_York_A_MaxPoint_Interest_Index_2013.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Sartorial New York_A MaxPoint Interest Index_2013.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/05/17_57_03_261_Sartorial.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"Sartorial.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMDUvMTBfMDVfMTNfMjlfU2FydG9yaWFsX05ld19Zb3JrX0FfTWF4UG9pbnRfSW50ZXJlc3RfSW5kZXhfMjAxMy5wZGYiXV0/Sartorial%20New%20York_A%20MaxPoint%20Interest%20Index_2013.pdf"	\N	2013-09-05 15:05:13.03243	2013-09-27 14:58:04.88855

1303	157	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>The entertainment industry is lucrative. Movie studios, recording labels, and entertainment store chains amuse millions of people in their leisure time&mdash;and they make an excellent profit in the process. According to the MPAA Theatrical Market Statistics, over 225 million people went to the movies at least once in 2012.<a href=\\"#_edn1\\" name=\\"_ednref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> In the music realm, it&rsquo;s estimated that music sales topped over $7.1 billion in 2012.<a href=\\"#_edn2\\" name=\\"_ednref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a> In other words, it&rsquo;s not just entertainment&mdash;it&rsquo;s good business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the booming entertainment industry, it&rsquo;s no surprise that artists, especially musicians, have crossed over into other forms of entertainment. One need look no further for proof than the upcoming Legends of the Summer Stadium tour, launched by superstars Jay Z and Justin Timberlake. It&rsquo;s not just a concert tour&mdash;it&rsquo;s a full-blown event tour that even includes an entertainment club complete with professional cigar rollers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To join in the spirit of the summer tour, MaxPoint compiled its July Interest Index to find the top neighborhoods for entertainment spending (on music, DVDs, and online videos). Once we found cities with the top neighborhoods, we drilled down to two on the Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour&mdash;Detroit and New York City&mdash;to find the top neighborhoods within those cities as well as their audience profiles. But before we look at Detroit and New York, let&rsquo;s take a look at the nation&rsquo;s top neighborhoods with higher than average spending on entertainment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Neighborhoods With High Entertainment Spending</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint analyzed billions of offline and online data points, including credit card transaction data, to discover cities that have neighborhoods with high entertainment spenders. We found that many of the neighborhoods corresponded to stops on the summer tour. Some of the top entertainment spending neighborhoods are located near:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Baltimore, MD</li>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>Chattanooga, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Detroit, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Toledo, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo better understand high entertainment spenders, we used our proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg; </sup>technology to focus in on two of these cities&mdash;two that fall directly on the summer tour&rsquo;s path. We looked at Detroit and New York City to uncover their top spending neighborhoods as well as the entertainment spender shopper profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Detroit&mdash;Top Neighborhoods and Audience Profile</strong><br />\r\nWithin Detroit, the top entertainment spending neighborhoods are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bloomfield Hills, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Birmingham, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Franklin, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Lake Orion Heights, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Orchard Lake, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Troy, MI</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen we looked at the profiles of residents in these neighborhoods, we found that they:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Make $100,000 per year or more</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college degrees</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn addition to their interests in entertainment, these shoppers can often be found reading content online about the economy, law and the government, sports, and yoga. In addition, their typical purchases fall into the following categories: cell phone services, department stores, insurance, mass grocery stores, and women&rsquo;s apparel stores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>New York&mdash;Top Neighborhoods and Audience Profile</strong><br />\r\nThe tour also stops in New York City&rsquo;s Yankee stadium. The high entertainment spenders are located in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Greenwich Village, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Grove Street, NJ</li>\r\n\t<li>Harsimus Cove, NJ</li>\r\n\t<li>Nolita, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>SoHo, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>West Village, NY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe New York City neighborhoods tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have incomes above $100,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Be college educated or higher</li>\r\n\t<li>Be between the ages of 35 and 54</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdditionally, our analysis of the interest data uncovered that the New Yorkers spend most of their online time reading and watching content on business and finance, the economy, food and drink trends, and sports. Based on our analysis of credit card spending patterns, they tend to spend on the following categories: children&rsquo;s apparel stores, department stores, family apparel stores, shoe stores, and women&rsquo;s apparel stores. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nUsing MaxPoint&rsquo;s ability to cull information from multiple offline and online data sources (analyzing more than a petabyte worth of data each day), entertainment advertisers can pinpoint qualified customers at scale and reach enough of them to boost their ticket sales, DVD sales, or attendance at concerts, sporting events, or amusement parks. And, by focusing on only the most relevant neighborhoods, the advertisers keep their costs down and their ad spend efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a movie studio releasing the DVD/Blue-Ray version of a popular children&rsquo;s film could leverage neighborhood-level targeting to boost sales. In this case, MaxPoint finds neighborhoods located within a tight radius around stores carrying the film that over-index for families with children aged 5&ndash;9. Then to get even more precise, credit-card data is leveraged to pinpoint those Digital Zips that spend more money on entertainment. This ensures that the studio only advertises to customers who are already highly likely to buy, keeping responses high and costs low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity for entertainment advertisers to use hyperlocal digital advertising to boost their response rates. And with MaxPoint, they reach enough customers to significantly increase their sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing its proprietary Digital Zip technology, MaxPoint has run many campaigns for entertainment-based advertisers. Two such campaigns are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Major Hotel Promoting a Concert: </strong>A major hotel venue wanted to sell tickets for a concert that would take place in the hotel. To help them, MaxPoint targeted neighborhoods in and near the city with residents who had spent money at the hotel, made over $70K per year, and had high levels of entertainment purchases. As a result, the campaign resulted in a CTR of over double the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A National Entertainment Chain Store: </strong>A national entertainment chain wanted to drive foot traffic to its locations via several promotional coupons for its grand re-opening. To help them, MaxPoint targeted neighborhoods within a tight radius of the stores that over-indexed for adults aged 25&ndash;45 with interests in gaming and high levels of entertainment purchases. The campaign produced a CTR that was 4 times the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <a href=\\"http://www.mpaa.org/Resources/3037b7a4-58a2-4109-8012-58fca3abdf1b.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.mpaa.org/Resources/3037b7a4-58a2-4109-8012-58fca3abdf1b.pdf</a><br />\r\n2. <a href=\\"http://www.riaa.com/keystatistics.php?content_selector=2008-2009-U.S-Shipment-Numbers\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.riaa.com/keystatistics.php?content_selector=2008-2009-U.S-Shipment-Numbers</a></p>\r\n", "title"=>"Suit & Tie Optional—Neighborhoods that Top the Entertainment Spending Charts", "pdf_uid"=>"2013/09/03/11_13_20_14_Suit_and_Tie_Optional_Neighborhoods_that_Top_the_Entertainment_Spending_Charts_A_MaxPoint_Interest_Index_2013.pdf", "pdf_name"=>"Suit and Tie Optional_Neighborhoods that Top the Entertainment Spending Charts_A MaxPoint Interest Index_2013.pdf", "sidebar_text"=>"", "sidebar_image_uid"=>"2013/09/05/17_54_07_13_Entertainment_Spending_Info.png", "sidebar_image_name"=>"Entertainment-Spending-Info.png", "sidebar_image_link_target"=>"_blank", "sidebar_image_link_page_id"=>"-1", "sidebar_image_link_external_url"=>"http://maxpoint.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMDMvMTFfMTNfMjBfMTRfU3VpdF9hbmRfVGllX09wdGlvbmFsX05laWdoYm9yaG9vZHNfdGhhdF9Ub3BfdGhlX0VudGVydGFpbm1lbnRfU3BlbmRpbmdfQ2hhcnRzX0FfTWF4UG9pbnRfSW50ZXJlc3RfSW5kZXhfMjAxMy5wZGYiXV0/Suit%20and%20Tie%20Optional_Neighborhoods%20that%20Top%20the%20Entertainment%20Spending%20Charts_A%20MaxPoint%20Interest%20Index_2013.pdf"	\N	2013-07-30 14:50:21.53465	2013-09-05 22:54:07.015501

Some order too much of one product and not enough of another. The vagaries of the economy, the increasing influence of e-commerce, online marketing and a greater recognition of evolving shopping habits made this past holiday season one of the trickier ones to project. As a result, it&rsquo;s created chaos regarding inventory management.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, you need to have just the right amount of the right products in stock (historically, Cabbage Patch Kids or Tickle Me Elmos) to keep the hordes at bay in December without having to liquidate a pallet of products in January. While inventory management and the ability to create a &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; model on the supply side is widely understood, the ability to manage just-in-time demand may keep you from having to offer a free Furby with every $20 purchase come Jan. 15.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow can retailers prepare not only for major holiday seasons like Christmas but for seasonal events and product launches to ensure the right product moves off the shelves at the right time? There&rsquo;s a secret weapon for driving product demand and it all starts at the local level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth small and large retailers should begin by evaluating their local digital advertising strategy in order to determine new ways to drive foot traffic to their stores. For instance, a retailer with excess inventory of a new toy could target only neighborhoods within a certain radius of stores with the excess stock. Rather than create a national or even regional campaign, the retailer can pinpoint neighborhoods where this toy would be of most interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTargeting at the neighborhood level helps to curb wasteful ad spending, eliminating the need to run a costly national campaign that would be irrelevant to most. By reaching prospects at the neighborhood level with digital campaigns, retailers can get much more targeted and serve the right ads to the right prospects at the right time to create demand for a product.

1349	164	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>Americans have retirement on their minds. A recent report from the Pew Research Center claims that for survey respondents between 36 and 40, &ldquo;53% say they are either &lsquo;not too&rsquo; or &lsquo;not at all&rsquo; confident that their income and assets will last through retirement.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not just 36&ndash;40 year olds&mdash;34% of respondents between 60 and 64 also lacked confidence in the size of their retirement nest eggs.<a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a> With more than 10,000 new baby boomers reaching retirement age every day, financial advertisers have a large, interested audience they can reach.<a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help advertisers target these customers preparing for retirement, MaxPoint leveraged its proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to develop two customer profiles. The first includes those who prepare for retirement by searching online for resources about more stable investments, debt elimination, and Social Security. This group is concerned about making the most out of their existing nest eggs in the coming years. The second group includes those who spend on financial services and make riskier investments in an effort to grow their nest eggs for when they reach retirement age. The following report shares some of our findings about the two audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Retirement Planner Profile and Locations</strong><br />\r\nWhen we analyzed the data from our Digital Zip technology, including our proprietary interest data, we learned that retirement planners:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are over 55 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Are less likely to have children in the house</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis audience is closer to retirement age and tends to choose stable investments over other financial investments. Their tolerance for risk is lower&mdash;so they focus on retirement rather than pure wealth generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our interest data shows that in addition to retirement planning resources, this group consumes content about organic living, elderly care, and the economy. Additionally, their purchases include video rentals, communication services (such as cell phones and Internet services), meals at quick service restaurants, and items from office supply chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top neighborhoods in the nation for retirement planners are located in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Columbus, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Orlando, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Seattle, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Financial Services Spender Profile and Locations</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint used its Digital Zip technology, including credit card purchase data, to build the profile of customers who spend on financial services, which include investment services, tax preparation, and other financial and accounting services. We found that these spenders:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are over 45 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college educations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are less likely to have children in the house</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis group is younger than the group that focuses on retirement planning. The consumers&rsquo; relative youth could explain why they&rsquo;re not as interested in retirement planning&mdash;they likely focus on riskier financial investments because they have more time until they retire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proprietary interest data revealed that financial services spenders have strong interests in interior design, foreign policy, eco-friendly living and products, and health and fitness. In addition to their financial services spending, they also spend their income at general merchandise stores (typically home goods stores), at home furnishing stores, and on consumer appliances and electronics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that the top neighborhoods in the nation that include financial spenders are found in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Chicago, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Houston, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Las Vegas, NV</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Miami, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough four cities appear on both lists, the two groups reside in different neighborhoods within those cities. For example, within the Los Angeles DMA, planners reside most heavily in Seal Beach while financial spenders live in Manhattan Beach. This demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the DMA to target customers at a neighborhood level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nIf you&rsquo;re in the finance business, this information can help you target audiences more precisely and build better, more focused creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, to promote retirement planning services, focus on areas with an older population. Your creative should speak to this crowd using images and messages that appeal to people close to retirement. And keep the Pew research in mind&mdash;consider focusing your message on alleviating financial worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a great time to be in financial planning. The oldest baby boomers have already exceeded the retirement age, and tons more join their ranks every day. If you want to get a bigger piece of the pie, then this data should help you get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about financial services spenders and retirement planners, check out our infographic, which includes heat maps for some of the top cities in each profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint has run several campaigns for retirement planners and for financial services spenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>National Non-Profit&rsquo;s Financial Planning Campaign&mdash;</strong>A national non-profit wanted to drive awareness of a financial planning and services program for African Americans and Hispanics. The program provides information and education on investing, debt elimination, and budgeting. To help, MaxPoint targeted Digital Zips around the nation that over-indexed for African Americans and Hispanics over 40 years old, with annual incomes between $25,000 and $75,000. The ad campaign produced a response rate that was 78% higher than the industry average.<a href=\\"#_ftn3\\" name=\\"_ftnref3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>National Private Banking Company&mdash;</strong>A private banking company wanted to build awareness of its programs and offerings. MaxPoint served ads in Digital Zips that over-indexed for married adults with annual household incomes above $100,000 and between $1 and $5 million in investible assets. The campaign resulted in a response rate that was more than three times the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref1\\" name=\\"_ftn1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a>. <a href=\\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/10/22/more-americans-worry-about-financing-retirement/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/10/22/more-americans-worry-about-financing-retirement/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref2\\" name=\\"_ftn2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a>. <a href=\\"http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/baby-boomers-retire/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/baby-boomers-retire/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref3\\" name=\\"_ftn3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a>.

1353	165	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Raleigh, N.C. &ndash; August 28, 2013 &ndash; </strong>To help advertisers target customers preparing for retirement, MaxPoint leveraged its proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to develop two customer profiles: those who prepare for retirement by searching online for resources about more stable investments, debt elimination and Social Security and those who spend on financial services and make riskier investments to grow their nest eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MaxPoint&rsquo;s Interest Index comes at a time when consumers are increasingly concerned about their retirement. A recent report from the Pew Research Center claims that, for survey respondents between 36 and 40, &ldquo;53% say they are either &lsquo;not too&rsquo; or &lsquo;not at all&rsquo; confident that their income and assets will last through retirement.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not just 36&ndash;40 year olds&mdash;34% of respondents between 60 and 64 also lacked confidence in the size of their retirement nest eggs. The profiles uncovered by MaxPoint help financial services companies capitalize on an existing trend, while also making their customers feel more secure about the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Conservative Retirement Planners</strong><br />\r\nUsing its Digital Zip technology, including credit card purchase data, MaxPoint was able to pinpoint the top neighborhoods in the country where consumer interest trended highest for stable or conservative retirement planning, such as savings rather than wealth generation. Based on research, MaxPoint found that typical planners tend to be 55 or older, own their homes and are less likely to have children in the house. The group trends high for interest in topics such as organic living, elderly care and the economy. Additionally, planners&rsquo; purchases include video rentals, communication services (such as cell phones and Internet services), meals at quick service restaurants and items from office supply chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following cities have neighborhoods that scored the highest when it comes to conservative retirement planners:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Columbus, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Orlando, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Seattle, WA</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The Financial Services Spenders</strong><br />\r\nAdditionally, MaxPoint identified shoppers who spend on financial services, including investment services, tax preparation, and other financial and accounting services. They found that the average spenders are older than 45, hold college degrees and are less likely to have children in the house. They trend high on interest in topics such as interior design, foreign policy, eco-friendly living and products, and health and fitness. In addition to their financial services spending, they also spend their incomes at general merchandise stores (typically home goods stores), at home furnishing stores, and on consumer appliances and electronics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following cities have neighborhoods that score the highest on financial services spenders:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Chicago, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Houston, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Las Vegas, NV</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Miami, FL</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>San Diego, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough four cities appear on both lists, the two groups reside in different neighborhoods within those cities. For example, within the Los Angeles DMA, planners reside most heavily in Seal Beach while financial spenders live in Manhattan Beach. This demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the DMA to target customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Retirement is such a personal matter, so it&rsquo;s key that financial advertisers target the right people with the right message,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, COO at MaxPoint. &ldquo;These profiles demonstrate how retirement planners are different from financial services consumers from demographics and interests to purchase behaviors. Advertisers can use this data to target the right audience and ultimately achieve higher campaign response rates while reducing impressions wasted on the wrong audience.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interest Data in Action</strong><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from the Interest Index, MaxPoint has run several campaigns for retirement planners and for financial services spenders, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A National Non-Profit&rsquo;s Financial Planning Campaign&mdash;A national non-profit wanted to drive awareness of a financial planning and services program for African Americans and Hispanics. The program provided information and education on investing, debt elimination and budgeting. To help, MaxPoint targeted Digital Zips around the nation that over-indexed for African Americans and Hispanics more than 40 years old, with annual incomes between $25,000 and $75,000. The ad campaign produced a response rate that was 78% higher than the industry average.</li>\r\n\t<li>National Private Banking Company&mdash;A private banking company wanted to build awareness of its programs and offerings. MaxPoint served ads in Digital Zips that over-indexed for married adults with annual household incomes above $100,000 and between $1 and $5 million in investible assets. The campaign resulted in a response rate that was more than three times the industry average.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>About the MaxPoint Interest Index</strong><br />\r\nUsing its unique <a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com/solution/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Digital Zip</a> technology, MaxPoint analyzes billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the United States such as offline point-of-sale data, credit card purchase data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About MaxPoint </strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store traffic for retailers and brands.

The 10 cities that rank highest on the holiday cheer meter include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Eau Claire, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Springfield, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Alexandria, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Ft. Wayne, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n\t<li>Ft. Smith, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Beaumont, TX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint analyzed data consumed by neighborhoods throughout the U.S. such as offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. The company then scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics, which cluster together indicating broader interest trends, over a period of time. The company used a composite score that consisted of a variety of holiday interests including &ldquo;holiday recipes,&rdquo; &ldquo;holiday decorating,&rdquo; &ldquo;best holiday movies&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the perfect Christmas gift,&rdquo; to compile the top 10 list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eau Claire and Springfield scored high in all dimensions of holiday interests, while other cities scored high in one area. For instance, Ft. Wayne scored so high in holiday baking alone that it ranked in the top 10 areas for holiday spirit. Similarly, Dallas scored highest in holiday decorations and was also able to make the list based on ranking highest in a single subject area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to MaxPoint&rsquo;s research, the areas with the most holiday spirit tend to have higher income and older populations as compared with the rest of the nation. On average, residents of the highest ranking cities had an average income of $80,000 per year and are 55 years old, compared to the national average of $50,000 per year and 37 years old, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We looked at billions of data points from across the U.S. that measure holiday cheer with the goal of finding which locales are most engaged and interested in anything related to the upcoming holiday season,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, president of MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;In this case, it&rsquo;s clear that cities in the central part of the U.S. are most excited about the holidays. This is the type of information that is helpful to retailers and brands looking to target a specific consumer segment with special deals or products. Through our Digital Zip technology, we&rsquo;re able to deliver the right audiences to the brands and retailers we work with and help them drive in-store traffic through precise online campaigns.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By incorporating multiple, rich, neighborhood-level data sources, MaxPoint&rsquo;s Digital Zip technology takes localized ad campaigns to a new level &ndash; pinpointing qualified neighborhoods at the most granular level. As a result, retailers and brands can execute highly targeted digital advertising campaigns that drive in-store traffic and sales. For example, in the case of the holiday spirit index, a retailer selling baking supplies could target a group of consumers that have expressed interest in holiday recipes with a digital campaign that will drive traffic to the nearest store location. Similarly, a brand can target consumers interested in the hottest new toy for toddlers, based on detailed demographic and interest information &ndash; rather than target a broad area that does not meet the description of potential buyers. This helps to eliminate wasteful spending by advertisers, who often roll out national holiday campaigns that are irrelevant to a number of audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store sales for retailers and brands. The company&rsquo;s Digital Zip&trade; technology delivers the most effective and scalable neighborhood-level online campaigns. MaxPoint can pinpoint qualified customers interested in purchasing a product with more precision than using traditional zip codes, ultimately offering accurate neighborhood-level targeting with national reach and local results. Founded in 2007, MaxPoint has offices in New York, Chicago, Austin and Raleigh-Durham.

1594	187	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p><strong>Morrisville, N.C. &ndash; December 7, 2011</strong> &ndash; <a href=\\"http://maxpoint.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MaxPoint</a>, the company that helps retailers and brands drive local in-stores sales with its innovative Digital Zip&trade; technology, today issued the results of an indexing study that analyzed billions of data points to determine the U.S. neighborhoods with the most holiday spirit. The 10 cities that rank highest on the holiday cheer meter include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Eau Claire, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Springfield, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Alexandria, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Ft. Wayne, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n\t<li>Ft. Smith, AR</li>\r\n\t<li>Green Bay, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Beaumont, TX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint analyzed data consumed by neighborhoods throughout the U.S. such as offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. The company then scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics, which cluster together indicating broader interest trends, over a period of time. The company used a composite score that consisted of a variety of holiday interests including &ldquo;holiday recipes,&rdquo; &ldquo;holiday decorating,&rdquo; &ldquo;best holiday movies&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the perfect Christmas gift,&rdquo; to compile the top 10 list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eau Claire and Springfield scored high in all dimensions of holiday interests, while other cities scored high in one area. For instance, Ft. Wayne scored so high in holiday baking alone that it ranked in the top 10 areas for holiday spirit. Similarly, Dallas scored highest in holiday decorations and was also able to make the list based on ranking highest in a single subject area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to MaxPoint&rsquo;s research, the areas with the most holiday spirit tend to have higher income and older populations as compared with the rest of the nation. On average, residents of the highest ranking cities had an average income of $80,000 per year and are 55 years old, compared to the national average of $50,000 per year and 37 years old, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We looked at billions of data points from across the U.S. that measure holiday cheer with the goal of finding which locales are most engaged and interested in anything related to the upcoming holiday season,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, president of MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;In this case, it&rsquo;s clear that cities in the central part of the U.S. are most excited about the holidays. This is the type of information that is helpful to retailers and brands looking to target a specific consumer segment with special deals or products. Through our Digital Zip technology, we&rsquo;re able to deliver the right audiences to the brands and retailers we work with and help them drive in-store traffic through precise online campaigns.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By incorporating multiple, rich, neighborhood-level data sources, MaxPoint&rsquo;s Digital Zip technology takes localized ad campaigns to a new level &ndash; pinpointing qualified neighborhoods at the most granular level. As a result, retailers and brands can execute highly targeted digital advertising campaigns that drive in-store traffic and sales. For example, in the case of the holiday spirit index, a retailer selling baking supplies could target a group of consumers that have expressed interest in holiday recipes with a digital campaign that will drive traffic to the nearest store location. Similarly, a brand can target consumers interested in the hottest new toy for toddlers, based on detailed demographic and interest information &ndash; rather than target a broad area that does not meet the description of potential buyers. This helps to eliminate wasteful spending by advertisers, who often roll out national holiday campaigns that are irrelevant to a number of audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About MaxPoint</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint&rsquo;s retail advertising platform drives in-store sales for retailers and brands. The company&rsquo;s Digital Zip&trade; technology delivers the most effective and scalable neighborhood-level online campaigns. MaxPoint can pinpoint qualified customers interested in purchasing a product with more precision than using traditional zip codes, ultimately offering accurate neighborhood-level targeting with national reach and local results. Founded in 2007, MaxPoint has offices in New York, Chicago, Austin and Raleigh-Durham.

1601	188	\N	3	SuccessStoryDetailComponent	"body"=>"<p>The holiday season has a long history of rich tradition. For many people, tradition means being with their families, eating delicious food, watching holiday movies, and giving gifts. These traditions get people into the holiday mood (and the shopping mood).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what do people buy to get into the holiday spirit? According to a forecast from the National Retail Federation (NRF), shoppers will spend an average of $201.10 on items that bring out their holiday cheer (not counting their gift purchases)&mdash;$100.35 on holiday candy and food, $51.60 on decorations, $28.03 on greeting cards, and $21.12 on flowers.<a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the holiday shopper, MaxPoint has its own tradition. Each year, we use our proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to locate and rank the top cities in the nation with the most holiday cheer. The cities that make the list are those most likely to decorate their homes, partake of holiday food and drinks, and throw holiday parties and gatherings for their friends, families, and coworkers. In addition to the top locations, we also built a profile of the shoppers with the strongest holiday spirit. This year, we saw some surprising shifts in both the top DMAs and the audience profiles, demonstrating the importance of using the timeliest intelligence for your digital advertising campaigns. The following report contains our findings for the 2013 holiday season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Cheeriest Cities in the Nation</strong><br />\r\nWe started by locating the top 10 cities that contain neighborhoods with the strongest interests in holiday-related topics. Believe it or not, this year&rsquo;s list differed fairly dramatically from the previous year&rsquo;s list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top 10 cities for 2013 are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Mankato, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Buffalo, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Wilkes-Barre, PA</li>\r\n\t<li>Sherman, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n\t<li>Portland, OR</li>\r\n\t<li>Sacramento, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Charlotte, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Dallas, TX</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Louis tops the list this year, unseating Salt Lake City, 2012&rsquo;s cheeriest city. Surprisingly, we saw only two cities from previous years reappear on our 2013 list: Buffalo and Dallas. Buffalo moved up to number three from the number seven spot on 2012&rsquo;s Index. After coming in at number five in 2011 and falling off the list in 2012, Dallas re-emerged this year as a contender. The dramatic change in the list emphasizes the fact that consumer spending patterns can shift quickly. As a result, it&rsquo;s important that you make sure you use the most up-to-date audience intelligence when making your advertising decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while each of these cities can claim holiday spirit bragging rights, certain neighborhoods are more festive than others. Near the St. Louis DMA, we found that the cheeriest neighborhoods were Brazito, MO, East St. Louis, IL, Osage Bluff, MO, Pleasant Mound, IL, and Steelville, IL. Advertisers looking to promote holiday-related decorations, treats, or cards will get the biggest bang for their advertising buck in these neighborhoods. No matter which festive city you choose, you&rsquo;ll get the most traction for your holiday digital advertising campaigns by focusing on specific neighborhoods rather than a broad DMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Profile of the Cheeriest Shoppers</strong><br />\r\nAfter scouting the top locations, we turned our Digital Zip technology to the task of developing a clear profile for cheery holiday shoppers. We saw some significant differences in this year&rsquo;s profile compared to previous years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, we found that these festive shoppers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are between 35 and 44 years old</li>\r\n\t<li>Have incomes between $25,000 and $60,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Are married</li>\r\n\t<li>Own their homes</li>\r\n\t<li>Tend to have children living in the home</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis profile makes a lot of sense&mdash;these shoppers decorate their homes to create a great holiday experience for their families and their children. Additionally, with their high home ownership levels, they have more creative freedom with their home decorations than their renting counterparts would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted before, we saw some demographic shifts from last year&rsquo;s profile. The 2012 group was above 55 years old and had incomes exceeding $100,000 per year. By contrast, the 2013 group includes younger families with lower incomes. Since consumer patterns can shift dramatically within a year, your campaigns must use real-time data. What worked last year may no longer be as effective this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we used our proprietary interest data to find out what else these holiday enthusiasts are interested in. The group consumes a lot of digital content on crafts, home improvement, the law and government, and retirement planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to their purchases of holiday decorations, these consumers also shop across several broad purchase categories, including discount department stores, office supply chains, pet stores, automotive retail stores, and general merchandise stores. These stores may see an uptick in sales this year from holiday shoppers looking to buy gifts or decorations for the holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since so much of the holiday season revolves around parties and holiday gatherings, we wanted to know what food would be on the trays and party tables at holiday bashes. We found that this audience was most likely to purchase Queen Anne<sup>&reg;</sup> chocolates, Keebler<sup>&reg;</sup> Sandies<sup>&reg;</sup> cookies, Act II<sup>&reg;</sup> popcorn, and sugary soft drinks. Of course, they may also buy candy canes&mdash;at five manufactured per person in the United States this year, they certainly won&rsquo;t be hard to find.<a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nAdvertisers can use the information about the neighborhoods with the most holiday cheer to build out their digital advertising program for the season. For example, an advertiser could promote holiday decorations and foods to the right neighborhoods in the cities that made this year&rsquo;s cheer list. Additionally, they could incorporate some of the audience&rsquo;s interests into their creative to make it more compelling. For example, they might show an image of a dog dressed in holiday gear to people shopping at pet stores, or they may show an image of a decorated house to those interested in home improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the holidays fast approaching, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you use your budget efficiently. You can do this by using neighborhood-level targeting that leverages audience intelligence culled from the freshest real-world data. Armed with the right technology, you can drive more sales, keep ad waste low, and finish the year strong without needing to increase your ad budget. And you&rsquo;ll end up having a happy holiday season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint has run several holiday campaigns for advertisers. Here are a few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holiday Massage Promotion&mdash;</strong>A massage service with many locations throughout the nation wanted to increase bookings in the Chicago area during the holiday season. The service knew that holiday shopping and decorating can get stressful, so it wanted to offer deals to help people unwind after hanging decorations in their homes. To help, MaxPoint targeted neighborhoods within six and eight miles of Chicago locations that over-indexed for adults over the age of 25 with household incomes exceeding $75,000 per year. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was more than twice the industry average.<a href=\\"#_ftn3\\" name=\\"_ftnref3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drugstore Holiday Deal&mdash;</strong>One of the nation&rsquo;s largest drugstores wanted to drive more Hispanic shoppers to its locations to purchase gifts&mdash;including cards, gift certificates, and toys. To help, MaxPoint targeted Hispanic adults between the ages of 18 and 49 who live within eight miles of store locations in Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston. The online video campaign resulted in strong engagement and a CTR that was more than three times the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holiday Coffee Campaign&mdash;</strong>The world&rsquo;s largest coffee seller wanted to boost sales of its coffee beans and branded coffee products at stores during the holiday season. It used digital advertising to offer a gift card to those who purchased its products at participating grocery stores. To help improve the campaign, we targeted women between the ages of 30 and 54 who had previously purchased coffee products. We limited the search to neighborhoods within six miles of participating grocery stores. The campaign resulted in a CTR that was more than twice the industry average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want to see your campaign on this list next year?

As millions tune in to watch the action, advertisers have the perfect opportunity to join the conversation and connect with their customers using Olympic-themed digital campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just how big of an audience can we expect this winter? Roughly 215 million Americans will watch the 2014 Winter Games over the span of three weeks.<a name=\\" _ftnref1\\">[1]</a> And this year, the Olympics will offer a big opportunity for using pre-roll video as the games will produce more than 1,000 hours of live streaming content.<a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help advertisers reach people who are getting into the Olympic spirit, we used our proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology to develop a profile of the most enthusiastic Olympic consumers. Armed with intelligence on the group&rsquo;s demographics, interests, and top purchases, advertisers can target the consumers most likely to respond to Olympic-themed campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Profile of Olympic Fans</strong><br />\r\nYou can spot an Olympic fan by the content that they consume online. Popular topics among Olympic fans include content on Shaun White, Gracie Gold, Olympic snowboarding, the Olympic curling team, and other related subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to demographics, Olympic fans:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Are between the ages of 25 and 54</li>\r\n\t<li>Have annual incomes exceeding $60,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Have college degrees or higher</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn addition to Olympic interests, these consumers frequently view content on allergy relief, heart health, weddings, and yoga. This data can guide advertisers as they develop their creative. For example, a consumer packaged goods (CPG) food company could promote the heart-healthy benefits of its cereal by serving ads that say, &ldquo;Keep your heart strong and healthy like the athletes on Team USA.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on their purchase histories, these fans are perfect prospects for women and family apparel retailers, department stores, music and video stores, and consumer electronics retailers. Any brand that stocks products in one of these stores should run Olympic-themed ads to make their digital campaigns more appealing to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, while the games are on, spectators will need something to snack on. Our point-of-sale data indicates that their favorite foods include Hershey&rsquo;s<sup>&reg;</sup> Symphony<sup>&reg;</sup> chocolates, Nabisco Classics cookies, Lean Cuisine<sup>&reg;</sup> frozen dinners, and Baked! Ruffles<sup>&reg;</sup> chips. Retailers that carry these treats should use Olympic-themed creative to connect with their potential customers and drive sales even higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where Are the Olympic Villages?</strong><br />\r\nEven though the 2014 games will take place in Sochi, Russia, you can find several &ldquo;Olympic villages&rdquo; in the United States. Neighborhoods in these cities have the highest concentration of Olympic fans:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Fargo, ND</li>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Los Angeles, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Denver, CO</li>\r\n\t<li>Nashville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>Boston, MA</li>\r\n\t<li>San Jose, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Huntsville, AL</li>\r\n\t<li>Seattle, WA</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou&rsquo;ll find tons of Olympic fans in any of these DMAs, but they&rsquo;re certainly not exclusive to the cities on this list. In fact, if you advertise only on the DMA level, you&rsquo;ll miss out on reaching the best neighborhoods. Take Fargo, the top city on our list&mdash;most of the Olympic fans live in the neighborhoods of Finley, Hillsboro, and Northwood. Even though you&rsquo;ll generate sales by targeting the entire Fargo DMA, you&rsquo;ll get the highest return by focusing on these three important neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What This Means for Advertisers</strong><br />\r\nEven if your brand isn&rsquo;t an official Olympic sponsor, you can still use hyperlocal digital advertising insights from MaxPoint to enhance your digital campaigns. For example, serving digital ads that incorporate winter sports imagery to neighborhoods that over-index for Olympic fans would be timely and resonate with the right shoppers during the games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the best thing you can do for your advertising results is to run a neighborhood-level campaign. By focusing on only the neighborhoods with crowds of ideal consumers who are interested in topics related to your product, you&rsquo;ll bring home the gold both during the Olympic games and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MaxPoint in Action</strong><br />\r\nOver the years, MaxPoint has helped brands and retailers run both Olympic-related and winter-themed campaigns:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Olympic Athlete Endorses Major Brand of Skincare Lotion&mdash;</strong>A major brand of body lotion ran a campaign featuring a well-known Olympic athlete. With MaxPoint&rsquo;s help, the brand used the celebrity endorsement to boost website visits, increase coupon downloads, and drive customer entries for a contest. MaxPoint targeted mothers between the ages of 25 and 54 with college degrees and household incomes above $50,000 per year. Additionally, we served ads in neighborhoods that over-index for purchases of competitor products, which helped the body lotion brand increase its market share. The campaign resulted in a response rate that was more than twice the industry average.<a href=\\"#_ftn3\\" name=\\"_ftnref3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ski Resort Sells Family Passes&mdash;</strong>One of the top ski resorts on the West Coast of the United States teamed up with MaxPoint to increase website visits and drive sales of ski passes. To help, MaxPoint targeted mothers between the ages of 25 and 54 who have children between the ages of 2 and 12 and who have household incomes above $150,000 per year. Additionally, we focused on families living close to the resort because they would be most likely to make the trip to hit the slopes. The campaign resulted in a higher-than-average response rate and boosted engagement with the resort&rsquo;s online properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CPG Company Runs Olympic Promotion with National Drugstore Chain&mdash;</strong>One of the world&rsquo;s leading consumer packaged goods companies ran an Olympic-themed promotion to boost awareness of its products at a partner drugstore chain&rsquo;s locations. To hit the campaign goals, MaxPoint ran a rich-media campaign targeting cost-conscious adults between the ages of 25 and 54 who frequently purchased products at retail drugstore chains. Additionally, we narrowed our ad impressions to neighborhoods within six and eight miles of the retail partner&rsquo;s locations. The campaign resulted in an interaction rate that was more than twice the industry average for rich-media campaigns.<a href=\\"#_ftn4\\" name=\\"_ftnref4\\" title=\\"\\">[4]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftn1\\" name=\\"_ftnref1\\" title=\\"\\">[1]</a>. <a href=\\"http://adage.com/article/media/nbcu-sold-a-record-800m-winter-olympics-ads/244454/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://adage.com/article/media/nbcu-sold-a-record-800m-winter-olympics-ads/244454/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftn2\\" name=\\"_ftnref2\\" title=\\"\\">[2]</a>. <a href=\\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/game-594261-espn-games.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/game-594261-espn-games.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\\"#_ftnref3\\" name=\\"_ftn3\\" title=\\"\\">[3]</a>.

Landing pages provide a non-generic point of entry to your website and your audience reaches that page with a specific intention in mind, such as downloading a coupon for example. Once you have gotten your audience to your landing page then go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back &ndash; your ad captured enough of their attention to click for more information!</p>\r\n	<p>When developing a digital campaign, we all know you also need a landing page, right? Landing pages provide a non-generic point of entry to your website and your audience reaches that page with a specific intention in mind, such as downloading a coupon for example. Once you have gotten your audience to your landing page then go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back &ndash; your ad captured enough of their attention to click for more information! <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, driving your audience to your landing page is not the last step; you also need to keep them engaged once they get there. That being said, the design of your campaign landing page will do the rest of the work. Below are a few guidelines to keep in mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Keep it Consistent</strong><br />\r\nFirst and foremost, make sure your messages match.&nbsp; Your digital ad and corresponding landing page should have the same call to action. It ensures your audience that they&rsquo;re in the right place to find the deal, offer, signup, etc. and it also tells them that you aren&rsquo;t pulling the &lsquo;ol bait-and-switch. Inspiring trust increases the likelihood of conversion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the visual design of your landing page should be geared towards the message of your campaign, it should stylistically feel like part of your greater online presence. The design should be similar to what people have experienced in the past from your brand&ndash; this helps to create a strong <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/brand-image.html" target="_blank">brand image</a>. Match the colors of your brand and use some subtle, or perhaps not-so-subtle, nods to the graphical elements on your main website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Keep It Simple</strong><br />\r\nClear and concise headlines should compel your audience to take a closer look but don&rsquo;t make them hunt for that call to action. Call to action buttons should stand out. Make it big, make it bright, and make it above the fold. Label the button with the exact action you hope for &ndash; Sign Up, Download, etc. For example, Mozilla saw a 3% increase in downloads from their Firefox browser landing page just by changing the button text from &ldquo;Try Firefox 3&rdquo; to &ldquo;Download Now &ndash; Free&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t confuse your audience by offering too many options for navigation. Remember, you want them to stick around. A link to items relevant to the offer and one to the main website should suffice. Also, minimize the number of clicks required for response. Each additional and unnecessary click is an opportunity to lose your audience. As a best practice, capture what you need on the first page. That being said, there&rsquo;s no better way to turn your audience away than to present them with a giant <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2011/8/29/best-practices-for-website-form-design" target="_blank">form</a>. Ask only for what you need and plan other ways to get the nice-to-haves late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Keep It Interesting</strong><br />\r\nCustomer testimonials, product images, or an engaging video are great ways to pull your audience in. Think of each item as a tool for persuading them to take the next step. And, all of these should be curated with the goal of conversion in mind. Graphics for the sake of graphics are not going to help convince your audience, and they may dilute your message &ndash; so take a giant step back from the stock art.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Keep Measuring It</strong><br />\r\nIn addition to delivering a targeted message, your landing page allows you to measure your digital campaign.&nbsp; Using web analytics will allow you to help calculate the ROI at the end of a campaign and can be used to unlock some clues on where you can improve an active campaign as well. For example, if your audiences drop off after hitting your landing page, you might examine your message and/or call to action. If people are dropping off midway through conversion, you might need to ask for less information or minimize the number of steps. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to make tweaks along the way. It&rsquo;s a great way to see what resonates best with your visitors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat works well for one campaign may not work well for all campaigns, but following these basic guidelines should help you to deliver a focused experience on your landing page and get you well on your way to accomplishing your conversion goal.

And, this applies for all retailers and brands (regional &amp; national).</p>\r\n	<p>In the past year in particular, online video advertising adoption has begun to grow at a rapidly increasing rate. According to a recent survey by BrightRoll, &quot;28% of media buyers expect to see the greatest increase in ad spending in the online video category for 2011.&quot; In addition, according to <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Reports/All/Emarketer_2000713.aspx" target="_blank">eMarketer</a>, its unique interactivity helps marketers more accurately measure the relationship between video ads and their influence on consumers. This being said, video advertising has quickly become a highly engaging way for retailers and brands to reach their audiences, driving in-store sales. And, this applies for all retailers and brands (regional &amp; national).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, we were pleased to announce our video targeting solution enabling digital advertisers to target their pre-roll video, reaching up to 90% of online users across high-quality and brand-safe content sites, including co-branded YouTube channels. Now able to target both pre-roll and in-banner video ads at a local level, marketers can ensure that the consumers most able to buy and interested in a product see the ad. Furthermore, <a href="http://dynamicvideoad.mixpo.com" target="_blank">Mixpo</a> has been a helpful partner throughout this process, enabling brands and retailers to easily leverage already existing investments in TV advertising or other creative into powerful, locally targeted online video ads.

To ensure that the video advertisements are successful, two things need to happen:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The video ad must reach only the most qualified audience: Video advertisements need to be targeted to run only where an audience who matches a brand&rsquo;s customized neighborhood profile is spending time. If the customers targeted are not able or interested in purchasing a product then the video solution is not being optimized to its full effect.</li>\r\n\t<li>The video ad should take into consideration the following: Define the goal of the video ad, keep it short and simple (:15 to :30 second video clips are ideal), get to the point, use effective visuals, and test different formats/messages with an audience test group before launch.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nKeeping these in mind, you are on your way to video advertising success!

Forms can be an important element to your digital campaign &ndash; requiring your audience to fill out a form for access to certain campaign collateral or maybe even digital coupons.</p>\r\n	<p>You&rsquo;re just about finished with your website or landing page for your digital campaign, and now all you need to do is add a web form. Forms can be an important element to your digital campaign &ndash; requiring your audience to fill out a form for access to certain campaign collateral or maybe even digital coupons. It&rsquo;s often the element standing between you and the information you want from your audience. Their uses range from sign up and payment, all the way to help and contact us. We all know forms and we all use them (at one point or another).<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeb forms are great because they not only let you collect information without giving your direct e-mail out but they can also collect the information you want, having the capability to set specific boundaries. However, while forms are an incredibly useful tool for tracking your audience&rsquo;s information, they also represent a big risk. Badly designed forms are one of the biggest reasons for site drop off (one of the last things you want to see when collecting web metrics).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to avoid this, here are some tips to help you get the most out of your forms:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Keep it Short</strong><br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s nothing that will make your audience close their browser window faster than encountering a really long form. Ask yourself if you really need all the information you are requesting. Just like designing a campaign, make it short, sweet and to the point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you&rsquo;ve taken out all the &ldquo;nice-to-knows&rdquo; and you still have a lot on your hands, consider breaking the form into separate chunks of related fields or even into multiple pages, similar to a wizard. Your audience should be able to see their progress - specifically, how much they have to go - on each page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Be Clear About What You Want</strong><br />\r\nUse field labels that your audience will understand. Your labels should be clear and descriptive &ndash; but also, short. If extra clarification is needed, use contextual help rather than a long, wordy label.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, make sure to distinguish between required and optional fields. An asterisk placed to the right of the label is an accepted standard. If your optional fields are by far the minority, it may make sense to indicate those instead of the required fields.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Implement with Care</strong><br />\r\nTry not to be too picky about the formats you accept. For example, if you are asking for a date, ideally the form should accept all versions (ex. 11/5/2011, 11/05/2011, 11-5-11, 11-05-2011 and November 5, 2011).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf there is an intelligent default value for an element, go ahead and select it. For instance, it&rsquo;s a good idea to select &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for country, when the vast majority of your users live in the US.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, allowing your audience to advance from one field to the next using the tab key is an absolute must.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Give Meaningful Feedback</strong><br />\r\nOnce your audience successfully submits the form, they should receive a success message. This message should confirm that their information has been submitted along with any available information about what to expect next. For example, &ldquo;You can now check your email for your login to the research study&rdquo; or &ldquo;A representative will contact you in the next 24 hours.&rdquo; This message can add a humanistic element that forms usually lack. It&rsquo;s important your audience leaves feeling that they have reached you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery form has the possibility for error and you will want to plan for that. Helpful error handling will be specific about which field has the error and what is expected.&nbsp; The error text should appear at the top of the form and the problematic field should be indicated in some way. An icon or highlighted fields are popular and effective options.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce your form is ready to use on your website or campaign landing page, you&rsquo;ll want to track its performance. Performance indicators like conversion and dropout rates are clear indicators about how you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s also helpful to capture submission errors. These can be really telling about any misunderstandings your audience is having. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tweak your form until you&rsquo;re getting the results you want. It may even be helpful to have a friend walk through the form while you watch and listen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information about designing great forms, check out these articles:<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/forms-usability/" target="_blank">How to Improve the Usability of Your Forms</a>, via UX for the Masses<br />\r\n<a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/04/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms/" target="_blank">Web Form Design Patterns: Sign-Up Forms</a>, via Smashing Magazine<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReally interested in form design?

Surprises also create suspense and encourage repeat visits.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCostco, for example, uses the term &quot;treasure hunt&quot; to explain why up to a fifth of its stock is limited-quantity items that are in the store for as little as a week.&nbsp; Some of that inventory is seasonal such as patio furniture and pool toys in summer. Some high end products such as bargain-priced Hunter rain boots, sold almost exclusively in the U.S. by Nordstrom are a top find for those hunting for the next great Costco deal.&nbsp; But you have to be quick&mdash;the inventory moves fast and is unlikely to return.&nbsp; The merchandise may not return but bargain hunters will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to an article in the Sun Herald in Mississippi, the wholesale chain shows that the treasure hunt strategy can pay. Revenue at U.S. Costco stores open at least a year was up 10 percent last quarter from last year, with strong growth in non-essentials like jewelry and home and garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This goes to show that once you get someone into their neighborhood store to grab the next best bargain, they will also stay and possibly purchase impulse items or consider other items they would normally buy online since they are already in the store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the flipside to continually adding and changing inventory, some retailers have tried the approach of paring down their inventory to the basics and removing many competing products.&nbsp; While this is a bold move in attempting to gain more market share, it unfortunately does not always prove to be successful.&nbsp; Not all ideas will work, but kudos for trying innovative strategies and seeing them through.&nbsp; Retailers should keep taking risks and trying new things to win the in-store sales race.</p>\r\n	t	2011-08-22 13:34:12	\N	2011-08-22 13:34:12	2013-10-23 18:09:49.889055	49	MaxPoint, Maxpoint Interactive, OnPoint, Lynn Vitello, inventory, retail inventory, in-store sales, pricing, Costco, Sun Herald

Missed opportunities being attributed to traditional advertising methods, despite the fact that the Hispanic culture group has gone digital.</p>\r\n	<p>In one of our recent posts, <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2011/10/7/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-why-traditional-ad-budgets-should-be-allocated-for-digital-2" target="_blank">Out with the Old, In with the New: Why Traditional Ad Budgets Should be Allocated for Digital</a>, we discussed how advertisers and brands really need to re-think online advertising as a way to effectively reach their audiences. In the post, we quickly came to the conclusion that the digital advertising route is becoming the more effective way to reach audiences (arguing this based on online ad spending predictions and consumer preference). And, while we generally discussed some of the reasons to make the transition, we thought we would take it one step further and follow up with a direct example.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLately, there has been a lot of discussion around the missed advertising opportunities within the Hispanic culture group. Missed opportunities being attributed to traditional advertising methods, despite the fact that the Hispanic culture group has gone digital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a recent Media Post <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=153564" target="_blank">article</a>, author Jose Villa, discusses how heavily advertisers &ldquo;play on and integrate&rdquo; digital themes in television advertisements directed towards the U.S. Hispanic culture. He focuses on pointing out the digital themes in TV ads to show that marketers do understand that digital media is a large part of the U.S. Hispanic reality. However, while advertisers are aware that Hispanics are heavy users of digital media, only 4.8% of all Hispanic media went to online media &ndash; shocking! And, this is ironic because clearly advertisers feel that the digital element is important to incorporate in traditional ad concepts&hellip;bringing Villa to the conclusion that it is clear there is some major inefficiency in how Hispanic advertising dollars are being spent. Quoting Villa, &ldquo;I would assume the account planners at the agencies that created the spots were looking at the same data we see all the time in writing their creative briefs&hellip;Hispanics are heavy users of all kinds of digital media.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, a recent eMarketer <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008524" target="_blank">post</a> also discussed how Hispanics are going digital, highlighting that they have the highest tablet/eReader adoption rate. After sharing some of these tablet/eReader adoption stats, eMarketer pointed out that this may be due to the &ldquo;tremendous&rdquo; buying power of Hispanic consumers &ndash; buying power projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2015. Again, this brings us back to the question: if Hispanics are both active and early adopters of digital technology and media, and have the buying power&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t you want to make sure to target digital advertisements to this group effectively?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKnowing the above, marketers are potentially missing a huge untapped market and need to make the transition from traditional to digital when it comes to Hispanic consumers. At the end of the day, an advertisement&rsquo;s success is dependent on its ability to reach the target audience (i.e. if the target audience is online then that is where the ads should be)!</p>\r\n	t	2011-08-24 13:00:24	\N	2011-08-24 13:00:24	2013-10-23 18:06:38.325839	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, consumers, digital consumers, traditional advertising, digital advertising, ad spending, Hispanic, eMarketer, Media Post, Jose Villa, traditional vs. digital

Technology is at our fingertips and it is important to keep up with the latest technology trends.

Technology is at our fingertips and it is important to keep up with the latest technology trends. However, while it is easy to spot some of these trends, others are harder to find and conquer, which brings us to Hadoop. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn its simplest form, Hadoop is an open-source (free) Apache Software Foundation product used by companies for data mining. And, this is important to companies because data mining allows you to store and process large amounts of data in an array of computers (your internal or cloud based IT infrastructure). This would be data that allows for statistical sampling, such as, internet data (things you need to know to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; internet behavior &ndash; i.e. page views) or shopping data (in our case). Hadoop uses an array of computers to store this data and provides a software framework that allows you process it in parallel. With these features, Hadoop makes it easier to analyze very large datasets. For instance, you could download terabytes of weather data and write your own analysis to discover trends. This leaves you with an analysis of what you would think is interesting about the weather, highlighting a certain trend (such as certain weather patterns that may be important to identify when rolling out certain campaigns).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, how does this work?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour data is stored as files broken into small blocks and replicated across multiple computers in your array. To perform an analysis, each computer in the array can process the blocks that it is storing. This allows all of the computers to analyze part of a large dataset simultaneously, in order to collect results faster (results being the data trends identified).&nbsp; For instance, 50 computers could process different portions of a data set simultaneously thus allowing the data to be processed much faster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy should you care?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>It&rsquo;s different:</strong> Unlike most data mining services, Hadoop allows companies to process large amounts of data collected across an array of computers (commodity servers) as opposed to specialized hardware like a mainframe or supercomputer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Easy Investment:</strong> Hadoop is a small up-front cost with predictable incremental growth as opposed to the costs associated with specialized hardware procuring and replacement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Parallel/Fast:</strong> Several computers can process data from the same data set simultaneously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Reliable:</strong> If one computer fails, its data files still exist on other computers and its processing tasks can be reassigned to another computer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you need to process large amounts of data (because it would take a ridiculous amount of time to process the data and find trends manually), Hadoop is the right software for you. And, Hadoop is now taking a turn towards usability as it becomes more user-friendly.

In today&#39;s post, we cover some strategies to help you better reach this growing audience.</p>\r\n	<p>Hispanics are the most rapidly growing demographic in the United States. The group already brings a lot of purchasing power to the US economy&mdash;Hispanic shoppers are estimated to spend up to $1.5 trillion by 2015.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In short, advertisers know how important it will be to reach these shoppers now and over the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Cell Phone" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTEvMTMvMDdfMzJfMDVfNjc1X0NlbGxfUGhvbmUuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Cell%20Phone.jpg" style="float:right; height:214px; margin:0px 15px; width:215px" />Recently, the Pew Research Center released some interesting intelligence about Hispanics. According to its report, Hispanic shoppers score higher than any other demographic (aside from young shoppers) when it comes to accessing the web via mobile device.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> So, what does this mean for your advertising strategies for reaching Hispanic shoppers?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Devote More of Your Budget to Mobile&mdash;</strong>Since mobile is such a great way to reach this audience, you&rsquo;ll want to put more money toward mobile ads. But don&rsquo;t stop using desktop ads altogether&mdash;just work with your digital provider to find the right mix.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Think Mobile Responsive&mdash;</strong>Since Hispanic shoppers respond to ads on mobile devices, make sure that you support the full mobile experience with a mobile-responsive site or landing page. Mobile shoppers and visitors will likely bounce from a site with a subpar mobile experience. Your ads invite shoppers to your site&mdash;make sure it&rsquo;s hospitable once they get there.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make Your Content and Deals Shareable&mdash;</strong>A report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau claimed that for Hispanics, word-of-mouth and sharing is key.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Many Hispanics see themselves as influencers and enjoy being the first to share deals and new products with their friends and family. Make it simple for them by offering easy sharing functionality on your content, ads, and promotions.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Support Multiple Languages on Your Mobile Site and Apps&mdash;</strong>If your company caters to a multicultural audience, then your website likely already supports multiple languages. But what about your mobile solutions? If you do have a mobile site, make sure to include multiple language support. If you have any apps or mobile loyalty programs, make sure you include versions in Spanish as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Post Spanish Ads on English Sites&mdash;</strong>Even though you should include Spanish language support, don&rsquo;t overlook placements on English-written sites. Many Hispanic shoppers frequent sites in English, and often the Spanish ads cut through the clutter on the site. You should target Hispanic shoppers wherever they are on the Web, whether a Spanish site or an English site.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As the size of the Hispanic audience continues to grow in the United States, smart advertisers will try to gain more market share. Work with your digital provider to get the right intelligence to power the mobile buys that will best help you reach your goals. There&rsquo;s a lot you can do to reach Hispanic shoppers&mdash;just make sure that you have mobile as a large part of your Hispanic advertising strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you advertise to Hispanics or to a multicultural audience?

More importantly, when consumers were exposed to the ad across multiple screens (TV, computer, mobile phone, and tablet), that percentage jumped to 74 percent, a 48 percent increase in ad recall.

More importantly, when consumers were exposed to the ad across multiple screens (TV, computer, mobile phone, and tablet), that percentage jumped to 74 percent, a 48 percent increase in ad recall. For a brand or retailer looking to drive in-store traffic, these ads can have quite an effect on brand and product preferences.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, with major broadcast events, such as, the elections and the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, traditional broadcast advertising spots will be priced at a premium, leaving little opportunity for regional and local retailers and brands to get the air time they may be used to. But, millions of consumers will be tuned into online video channels for updates and coverage of these major events -- making digital video advertising an especially lucrative opportunity for retailers and brands of all sizes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Forrester Research, U.S. online video ad spend will reach $5.4 billion by 2016 &ndash; it&rsquo;s a rising digital force that advertisers are allocating more dollars to today. Whether it&#39;s a small retailer trying to gain visibility and drive in store traffic in a local market, or a large brand looking to complement a major national campaign with a digital video campaign that gives them additional reach, the medium provides a wealth of opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next phase in online video&#39;s expansion is in obtaining reach and relevance among the audiences that matter most. This is done by applying &quot;big data&quot; analysis or knowledge derived from large offline data sets pulled from point-of-sale information, social media, videos, music, local web pages, and online magazines. Brands and retailers armed with this information can more efficiently reach households by executing digital video campaigns, while complementing their traditional offline media plans. This approach makes it far more effective to reach the right consumer at the right time -- especially if you are looking to drive in-store traffic and sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, advertisers now have a way to make this data actionable for the benefit of their campaigns. For instance, if a car manufacturer was looking to drive sales of a higher-end luxury car, it&#39;s unlikely that it would want to target areas that house a high population of college students. There is no need to re-invent creative either -- it can simply tailor the video used in the national spot, and have it display in targeted areas where the consumers are most likely to purchase the product live. In the case of a smaller retailer or restaurant, digital video advertising campaigns not only make advertising more attainable, but they also help to eliminate wasteful advertising spending, which is often a large line item for a small business.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the exponential growth of online video advertising is telling us anything, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an ever-evolving and effective medium for retailers and brands of all sizes. Whether your goal is to complement traditional offline and broadcast campaigns or to dedicate the entire budget to online video, this growing medium is fast becoming one of the most cost-effective and influential ways to reach your relevant audience and drive in-store traffic.</p>\r\n	t	2012-04-26 14:14:14	\N	2012-04-26 14:14:14	2013-09-27 02:48:47.727457	51	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, online video, in-store traffic, in-store sales, digital video advertising, digital, big data

But advertisers shouldn&#39;t get too excited...</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="mobile phone on plane" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTEvMjcvMTNfMzVfMzFfMzI2X01vYmlsZV9waG9uZV9vbl9wbGFuZS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/Mobile%20phone%20on%20plane.jpg" style="border-style:solid; border-width:0px; float:right; height:250px; margin:5px 10px; width:377px" />Thanksgiving is just around the corner. People will be traveling all over the country, visiting family and friends in time for turkey. And for the first time, new guidelines from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will allow airline travelers to use approved electronic devices through the duration of the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, some advertisers <a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/strategy/16521.html" target="_blank">were excited at the possibility</a> of reaching more shoppers while they&rsquo;re on planes. However, the new guidelines offer more hype than hope for advertisers this holiday season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the new rules don&rsquo;t really add much to the current online environment. They won&rsquo;t make more people hop on the Wi-Fi on the planes, and they only add a few extra minutes for those who already surf the web while in the skies. The new rules might be more convenient for frequent fliers, but they&rsquo;ll make little difference for advertisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, you won&rsquo;t reach enough shoppers to really make a large sales difference. The FAA guidelines still require that phones be placed on airplane mode, meaning that most travelers won&rsquo;t have web access while on the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about Wi-Fi access provided by the airlines? Well, many planes aren&rsquo;t Wi-Fi enabled. However, even among those who fly on Wi-Fi planes, only 6% will pay the fee to use the service.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Many who do opt for in-flight wireless access could be focusing on work or checking email rather than shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, you still need to consider the best practices for ad personalization and audience intelligence. Even though passengers are on the same plane, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they&rsquo;re interested in the same products and services. On any flight, you&rsquo;ll reach a broad audience with diverse tastes&mdash;for example, some prefer to eat fast food in the airport while others seek out a nice restaurant near their hotel. With so little insight into the passengers on a flight, you&rsquo;ll end up wasting a lot of your budget on the wrong target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your better bet when targeting customers is to focus on their points of origin. People who choose to live in a certain neighborhood share quite a bit in common&mdash;they often have similar demographics, share interests, shop at the same stores, and have overlapping purchases. Armed with the right neighborhood intelligence, you can reach the perfect customers at a scale that really makes a difference. Most airline passengers share little in common with their fellow travelers other than their destinations. You&rsquo;ll waste a lot of impressions trying to target any specific audience on a plane. When it comes to targeting the right customers, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where they currently are&mdash;it matters where they come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One common example mentioned when talking about in-flight advertising is for rental car companies. This seems like an excellent use case&mdash;the rental company could advertise to a captive audience in the air that might need to book a rental car. However, this example breaks down upon closer examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many travelers will be heading to places where transportation will already be provided by their families, friends, or employers. And those fliers who will rent cars at their destinations will often have already booked their reservations before they reach the airport. Once they&rsquo;re on the plane, they&rsquo;re unlikely to be strong prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if a rental car service really wants to personalize its message to the right shoppers, it should use neighborhood-level targeting to tailor its message based on its intended audience. For example, the company could promote SUVs and minivans to neighborhoods that over-index for the presence of children and it could advertise luxury cars to people living in high-income neighborhoods. By segmenting its ad buys, the rental car company can reach the perfect shoppers and keep its ad waste to a minimum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For digital advertisers, the in-flight audience is just too broad to be an efficient media spend. And with so few passengers opting to use Wi-Fi, you&rsquo;ll have a hard time reaching customers at a meaningful scale. In short, if you want to really boost your sales, you should keep your digital advertising on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-faa-device-rules-for-mobile-marketing-2013-11" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-new-faa-device-rules-for-mobile-marketing-2013-11 </a></p>\r\n	t	2013-11-27 19:31:30	\N	2013-11-27 19:34:18.814007	2013-11-27 19:37:20.703266	59	\N

Store managers greeted customers at the door and shoppers walked up and down the aisles, pulling out items and admiring the displays - the ultimate in-store experience.&nbsp; However, times have changed and so has our local shopping experience. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA recent RSR research study, &ldquo;<a href="http://maxpoint.com/rsrreport" target="_blank">The Local Approach: The State of Localized Advertising in Retail</a>,&rdquo; reviews how stores used to be the original &ldquo;local&rdquo; face to customers, creating personal experiences for shoppers. The study moves on to discuss that as chain retailing grew in size, the personal-local experience became more difficult to deliver &ndash; giving way to the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; experience. This &ldquo;standard&rdquo; experience is one most shoppers are familiar with today. It is a way to deliver a consistent overall brand across all stores, no matter what store a customer visits. However, more retailers are realizing the importance of not letting local be a past-time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, a consistent brand message adds value but shoppers in different geographic locations want different things. According to the authors, technology now allows retailers and brands to provide central control over brand promise, while also allowing retailers and brands to bring back the local flavor to different store locations. For instance, customize messaging for certain campaigns to appeal to a specific target area or customize the delivery of a campaign so it only reaches a specific target area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rest of the RSR research study tackles this question of localized advertising &ndash; focusing on how well retailers are using localization in their communication strategies to drive traffic to stores. RSR research finds that retailers are &ldquo;laser-focused&rdquo; on providing a single brand identity across channels but challenged to redefine the role of the store in a cross-channel world.

This potentially presents a big opportunity for grocery stores. This partnership would certainly be a win-win for both parties. The store sells the ingredients to consumers who want to mimic the recipes sold from the food truck, and the food truck gets prime space, a hefty lunch crowd and experience in running a mobile restaurant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the article implies, this seems to have a large 20-something entrepreneurial following for a stepping-stone to bigger and better ventures such as restaurants or food shops. And, as more value-minded people are looking for a refreshing spin on the typical lunch, food trucks with creative spirit and menus could be the perfect cure from the &ldquo;dollar menu&rdquo; to the &ldquo;energizing menu.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImagine something as simple and satisfying as a melon, Gorgonzola, walnut and fresh basil salad for under $3. It&rsquo;s made from four ingredients, simple and quick. And, trust me, absolutely delicious, fresh and healthy. The food truck sells it by the pound for lunch. The grocery store sells the ingredients so you can make it at home for the family, and while you&rsquo;re there, you will likely pick up extra milk for the kids, orange juice for breakfast and perhaps fresh bread to go with that salad!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I have said over and over, the key to driving in-store sales in this online world of faster, easier, and cheaper is to be creative &ndash; look beyond the old ways of doing things. Take risks with your marketing and you will find big rewards!</p>\r\n	t	2011-10-07 22:22:37	\N	2011-10-07 22:22:37	2013-10-23 17:15:14.957813	49	food trucks, MaxPoint Interactive, MaxPoint, Lynn Vitello, OnPoint, grocery stores, in-store sales, grocery sales , Supermarket News

Each of their just less than 120 stores is staffed with expert outdoor enthusiasts.&nbsp; In addition to being a retailer, they have become advisors for consumers considering purchases of outdoor equipment. It&rsquo;s one of their biggest strengths as a brand and it&rsquo;s also why I choose to shop with them. &nbsp;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust the other day I visited a neighborhood REI store to try out a mountain bike. Not only was the person assisting me an avid cyclist, she knew the trails in my area I intend to ride, and she was a &ldquo;she&rdquo; - perfect for recommending a women&rsquo;s bike. The experience was personal: tailored to me, my needs, my budget and my particular location. In the end, I felt confident and excited about my purchasing decision. The experience was everything that Lynn didn&rsquo;t get out of her visit to the <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2011/10/7/poor-customer-service-can-undo-retailers-efforts-to-drive-in-store-sales-2" target="_blank">local tennis shop</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis excellent in-store service gives REI quite a bit to live up to when it comes to their social media strategy. When REI rolled out their regional twitter strategy recently, I realized that they had clearly hit the nail on the head, or perhaps in their case, packed the right gear for the trip. This approach will enable REI to most closely parallel the tailored, engaging two-way conversation that they have perfected in their stores. Rather than have one centralized team representing the company as a whole, there will be regional accounts, allowing for knowledgeable dialog between consumers in a specific area and REI&rsquo;s expert employees. This should enable them to follow many best practices of social media &ndash; specifically, being very responsive, knowing your audience and speaking in the same way they do. Outdoor experiences vary depending on location, so it is great that REI can tailor to consumers different local outdoor needs while maintaining their national brand reputation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, this divide and conquer approach isn&rsquo;t without obstacles. REI will divide their twitter followers and risk creating confusion about which account to follow. I just logged in; eager to be one of the first followers for my region, and in a quick glance only came across the central company account. Perhaps even more daring than spreading their followers is allowing so many people to publicly speak for their brand in real time. Yet, this worries me less.&nbsp; REI is currently doing such a great job of leveraging employee talent and enthusiasm; I can&rsquo;t help but think their efforts will translate seamlessly to the online space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile REI may have some challenges in front of them, they definitely have the right idea about tailoring their social media to fit consumers&rsquo; needs in different &ldquo;neighborhoods&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more ideas about deciding what social media strategy that is right for you, check out these resources:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor some best practices:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/07/twitter-brand-strategies/" target="_blank">Twitter for Brands: 6 Winning Strategies to Learn From</a>, via Mashable<br />\r\n<a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/mikestopforth/264131/twitter-strategy-brands-part-1-your-profile" target="_blank">Twitter Strategy For Brands Part 1: Your Profile</a>, via socialmediatoday<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2095174/people-connect-marketed" target="_blank">People Want to Connect With You, Not Be Marketed to</a>, via ClickZ<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd a few things to be sure to avoid:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-terrible-tweet-types-killing-your-twitter-strategy-2011-5" target="_blank">10 Kinds Of Tweets That Are Guaranteed Brand-Killers</a>, via Business Insider</p>\r\n	t	2011-10-07 21:56:08	\N	2011-10-07 21:56:08	2013-10-23 17:38:01.491938	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Lora Edwards, REI, social media, Twitter strategy, local, national brand, regional Twitter strategy, Mashable, socialmediatoday, ClickZ, Business Insider

Otherwise, we would still be carrying around 3 pound portable phones and wishing our dial-up connection would hurry up. But, if change is good, then why are marketers still relying heavily on&nbsp; traditional advertising methods when advertising has gone digital?<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvertisers and brands really need to re-think online advertising as a way to effectively reach their audiences. Today, most consumers live in the digital space, receiving their news and connecting with friends online. In fact, digital is the number one way to reach a broad (and highly demanded) demographic: 18-54 year olds. Relying upon the Internet more and more to receive and gather information, consumers have indeed turned into &ldquo;digital consumers&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to U.S. Census data, 75 percent of consumer spending occurs within 15 miles of the average American&#39;s home; meaning that 50 percent of the nation&#39;s GDP is dependent on consumers buying locally. With these statistics in mind, it&rsquo;s important for brick-and-mortar businesses and the brands within them to connect with consumers in order to drive in-store activity. Unfortunately, the standard methods of reaching local audiences through advertising for the last six decades &ndash; local newspaper, TV and radio ads, direct mail and/or Free Standing Inserts (FSIs) &ndash; just aren&#39;t as effective anymore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the obvious reasons why traditional methods may not be as strong as they used to be, a significant imbalance still exists in terms of retailers&rsquo; and brands&rsquo; ad spending, with online still a distant third to TV and print. To highlight this issue more specifically, consider that consumers spend 12% of their time consuming print media; yet, 26% of the typical ad budget is still spent on print media. In addition, the budget currently spent online is actually not highly targeted enough to successfully drive people through the doors of a store. Spending that same budget online, with effective targeting, can drive traffic into stores where purchases are made. Consumers usually research a store online before visiting the store, so it is imperative to have the right presence online. Effectively reach consumers online; effectively drive in-store traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a few things advertising and brands should keep in mind when using online advertising. Specifically, it is the scale and reach, cost-effectiveness, speed and flexibility of digital that enables advertisers to accomplish goals print cannot. When you take into account the average CPM of digital (~$5) vs. print (~$17), you immediately see a huge cost and reach advantage. Plus, digital intrinsically offers greater flexibility for your campaign. You can start and stop it as needed. You can even target different ads to different neighborhoods around the country. And this all comes with much shorter insertion lead times (e.g., minutes vs. weeks).Furthermore, with print, advertisers have to guess what ads will work and what ads will not. With online, advertisers can change campaigns on the fly, better aligning with consumer interests and hot selling products in the store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvoid the same classic media mix of newspaper, radio and television advertising. Once you&rsquo;ve reconciled the imbalance in the media mix with the actual rates of digital media consumption by today&rsquo;s consumer, you can properly target your digital ads and see an immediate and measurable lift in product sales and increased engagement. See, change is good, so what are you waiting for?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more stats on digital, check out these resources below:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008509" target="_blank">Options for Online Video Ad Viewers Lead to Greater Engagement</a>, via eMarketer<br />\r\n<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/05/online-ad-spending-50-bilion/" target="_blank">Online Ad Spending Set to Hit $50B in 2015</a>, via Mashable</p>\r\n	t	2011-10-07 21:45:45	\N	2011-10-07 21:45:45	2013-10-23 17:40:39.672405	50	digital advertising, traditional advertising, MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, ad spending, digital, digital consumers, in-store traffic, eMarketer, Mashable, digital vs. traditional

Brands have social media accounts that invite consumer engagement, digital coupons can be downloaded in an instant and the space to serve ads can be used for the most creative of campaigns. Unfortunately, this tremendous opportunity to connect with consumers is strained due to the issue of consumer privacy.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nData is a fundamental part of marketing campaigns, and data tracking has been an even more fundamental part of how most online campaigns are executed. Take display ads for instance, data identifies who (consumers) visit certain sites most frequently, identifies trends and then uses data collected about consumer behavior (without the consumer knowing) to target more ads. According to a <a href="http://www.netmining.com/pdf/Netmining-Mapping-Digital-Display-Landscape.pdf" target="_blank">post</a> in Netmining, a marketer can target a consumer on a website who display certain behaviors when visiting that website &ndash; i.e. you ditch your shopping cart and then the marketer invites you to free shipping and to continue with your purchase. Third party data collected on consumers (demographic, psychographic, purchase history, etc) is also frequently used to compile &ldquo;cookie pools&rdquo; which then implements a cookie to follow and track a consumer online. Ultimately, once a consumer clicks on ad, they are finding less ways to opt out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, consumers are finally speaking up. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission started looking into potentially regulating online marketing. The issues surrounding consumer privacy are regarded as &ldquo;unfair or deceptive acts or practices&rdquo; and is suggested that companies, in particular high tech companies, do not take the FTC guidance about consumer privacy lightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, if leveraging data helps marketers target the right customers to serve a relevant ad, what&rsquo;s a marketer to do?

When the lights went down and Oreo tweeted a relevant display ad within minutes, it set a new ideal for brands. As a result, many heralded 2013 as the year of real-time advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, several recent articles (such as these from <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-advertising-week-2013/5-hyped-trends-big-hits-advertising-week/244410/" target="_blank">Advertising Age</a> and <a href="http://digiday.com/brands/brands-killed-real-time-marketing/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Digiday%20Brands%20Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Brands_Sailthru_July2013" target="_blank">Digiday</a>) have highlighted some problems with real-time advertising. Some have gone so far as to say that the real-time advertising trend is dead. However, this pronouncement is premature. Today, I want to address two key myths about real-time advertising. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Myth 1: Real-Time Advertising Is Too Resource Intensive</strong><br />\r\nMany believe that real-time advertising requires excessive planning and resources. The thought here is that to respond to a major cultural event such as the Oscars or the Super Bowl, a brand must have its creative agency on call to quickly cook up an advertisement and must have its executives at the ready to review and approve. However, this view of real-time misses the bigger picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that a major fast food chain wants to create a real-time ad to boost sales in the cities for teams in the MLB World Series. It could create two separate digital banner ads that congratulate each team for the win. Once the Series concludes, the advertiser could post its congratulations to the winning team and offer a special deal for anyone who comes into the restaurant wearing their team&rsquo;s hat. This would be a perfectly relevant real-time advertisement that would boost sales and improve the brand&rsquo;s perception among baseball fans, and it would only require a little prior planning. And with the right targeting technology, the chain can ensure that it reaches the right neighborhoods with the right fans. It&rsquo;s real-time advertising without the real-time headache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Myth 2: Real-Time Ads Aren&rsquo;t Successful</strong><br />\r\nMany see Oreo&rsquo;s advertisement as a success because of the press it generated for the brand. But few know whether or not the advertisement increased brand perception or moved more cookies. Without this knowledge, it&rsquo;s difficult to say whether or not Oreo&rsquo;s ad was successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real-time advertising campaigns don&rsquo;t need to get a lot of press or latch onto a major national event to produce strong sales for a retailer; they only need to be relevant. For example, a pharmacy selling allergy remedies can use weather data to serve ads in locations with higher pollen counts during allergy season. This won&rsquo;t generate the buzz that Oreo received around the Super Bowl, but it will certainly sell more remedies to allergy sufferers looking for relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Truth: Real-Time Advertising Can Be Easy and Successful</strong><br />\r\nThe truth is that real-time advertising can be both relatively easy to implement and extremely successful. For example, let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re advertising for a restaurant. You can simply prep a few ads in advance and serve them based on weather patterns. In areas where the weather is cold or snowing, you could run an ad for chili or soup with the headline, &ldquo;Snowing? Warm up with a nice bowl of hot soup.&rdquo; Alternately, when the weather is extremely warm, you could appeal to shoppers with an ad that says, &ldquo;Cool off from this heat wave with a nice bowl of ice cream.&rdquo; All it takes is a little planning combined with the right technology that can help you adapt to local weather patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not receive major press attention with this approach. But you&rsquo;ll get sales, and you&rsquo;ll improve your brand perception among your target audience. Real-time advertising fulfills the basic promise of advertising&mdash;to connect brands with the right customers in the right locations at the right time. That&rsquo;s every advertiser&rsquo;s dream, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you tried any form of real-time or time-sensitive advertising?

Read this post to see how it all turned out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	<p>Every year, I look forward to the MaxPoint end-of-year party. After working hard for 12 months, the entire company comes together to relax, dance, and let loose with our co-workers. But over the past few years, we have also had the chance to give back to the community by volunteering for the John Avery Boys &amp; Girls Club of Durham. Last year, we assembled bikes as gifts for children; this year, we stepped it up a notch by helping them redesign their classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve ever met a MaxPointer, you&rsquo;ll realize how competitive we get. Whenever a few of us gather, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of time before someone decides to turn it into a competition. As a result, we decided to divide the company into teams that would compete for the award of the best-designed classroom (naturally, my team won).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Planning the Event:</strong><br />\r\nA few weeks before the event, I traveled with a teammate to the Boys &amp; Girls Club to scope out the classrooms. The room was fairly well organized, but could definitely use some additional decorations to spice things up:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Surveying the classroom</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Before Photo" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMDlfNTlfMDBfNjRfSU1HXzA2MjFfNTE4eDM0NS5wbmciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/IMG_0621_518x345.png" style="float:left; height:266px; width:400px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we returned, we called a meeting to walk the group through the space so we could develop our plan of attack. The entire team worked together to plan the space and purchase the decorations. One teammate even consulted with his teenaged daughter for some design ideas (she decided on a disco ball). After the meeting, we just had to order the supplies and wait for the big day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designing on a Dime:</strong><br />\r\nWhen we arrived, we gathered together in the gym. Because we were assigned to the teenager room, we named our team Smells Like Team Spirit:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Arriving in style</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Arriving in Style" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDFfMzdfMzIyX0lNR18wNzk2X1VwZGF0ZWRfMjY2eDMyOS5wbmciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/IMG_0796-Updated_266x329.png" style="float:left; height:329px; width:266px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we went to our room and immediately rolled up our sleeves. My teammates put me on sweeping duty:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cleaning the floors</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Cleaning the floors" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDJfNTVfMjE1X0lNR18wOTQ0X1VwZGF0ZWRfNDE0eDM0NS5wbmciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/IMG_0944-Updated_414x345.png" style="float:left; height:292px; width:350px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others worked on hanging some lights or installing mirrors on the wall:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hanging lights</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Hanging the Lights" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDNfNTZfMjkyX0lNR18wOTQ3XzM0Nng1MTkucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/IMG_0947_346x519.png" style="float:left; height:399px; width:266px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Putting up mirrors</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Hanging the Mirror" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDVfMjhfNDAwX0lNR18xMDA5XzUxOHgzNDUucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/IMG_1009_518x345.png" style="float:left; height:233px; width:350px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had a little help from Eric, the teacher from the Boys &amp; Girls Club. He gave us some great tips on what would resonate most with the kids. However, I think the best part of having him there was being able to see his reaction as the room began to come together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire redesign took about only four hours, but the results were dramatic:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Our team gathers in the completed room</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Team Photo" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDZfMDlfODU1X0lNR18xMDUzXzUxOHgzNDUucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/IMG_1053_518x345.png" style="float:left; height:233px; width:350px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Spending time with the kids</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Spending time with the kids" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDdfMzFfOTk1X0lNR18xMTQ1XzUxOHgzNDUucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/IMG_1145_518x345.png" style="float:left; height:233px; width:350px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked Monica Wood, one of my fellow team members, what she thought about the entire project. &ldquo;This was the best volunteer experience I&rsquo;ve ever had. It&rsquo;s rewarding to be able to see the difference you make when you volunteer. Frankly, I teared up a few times.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I share Monica&rsquo;s sentiments. It&rsquo;s always great to make a difference, but it&rsquo;s even better to be able to see the effect of your work. Of course, it&rsquo;s also fun to take a break and play some games with the kids:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Playing Connect Four</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Connect Four" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTkvMTBfMDhfNTBfNjA1X0lNR18xMDI2X1VwZGF0ZWRfNTE4eDM0NS5wbmciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/IMG_1026-Updated_518x345.png" style="float:left; height:233px; width:350px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Surprise Announcement:</strong><br />\r\nAt the end of the day, we gathered in the gym to find out which team won the contest. But Joe Epperson, MaxPoint&rsquo;s CEO, had a better surprise for us&mdash;he announced that MaxPoint would be sponsoring the <a href="http://bgca.org/ClubTech/ClubTech/Pages/ClubTech.aspx" target="_blank">Club Tech program</a> in 2014. Throughout the next year, MaxPoint will provide funds for equipment and field trips, and MaxPoint employees will donate their time to help the kids explore careers in technology. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, I had a blast. I got a chance to work with fellow MaxPointers from across the nation who I don&rsquo;t frequently see, and I was able to see the effects of my work on the kids and the teachers at the club. And honestly, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what we get to do next year!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/MaxPoint-Interactive/275921092465603" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to see more photos from the event.</p>\r\n	t	2013-12-19 14:17:53	\N	2013-12-19 14:20:10.812403	2013-12-19 16:22:39.574339	47	\N

These 2-dimensional barcodes are incredibly versatile - and, they are opening lots of doors for advertisers! There are many ways to use QR codes to engage and connect with your audience.&nbsp; You can further your consumers&rsquo; brand experience by allowing them to access a website, make a phone call, or view a video right from the camera on their smart phone. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile QR codes have already made a name, they are still relatively new to the U.S. It&rsquo;s hard to say if they are around to stay but they certainly have lots of potential. This is what I&rsquo;ve observed so far.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Good</strong><br />\r\nQR codes relieve a lot of the hassle of real-time engagement &ndash; there&rsquo;s no more typing in a long URL or SMS code. They&rsquo;re a quick, error-free scan! Once consumers have a QR reader application downloaded to their phone, they can begin to learn more about what you have to offer, interact with you, or explore your products. QR codes provide trackable results. You can see how many people are engaging with your campaign/ brand in real-time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore importantly, QR codes can assist with in-store shopping, with the goal of driving in-store sales. For example, cooking stores use QR codes to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions. The barcode is placed on certain products for shoppers to scan and find relevant recipes they can make with the cooking product. According to an article in <a href="http://www.dmnews.com/qr-codes-enhance-the-in-store-experience/article/201338/">Direct Marketing News</a>, you can&rsquo;t always rely on a store employee to be right there to answer questions and sales displays do not say everything. QR codes can address this issue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Bad</strong><br />\r\nQR codes do require an internet connection - and preferably a fast one. Many users may lose patience waiting for the scan to happen on a shaky 3G signal. However, the biggest downside to QR codes right now isn&rsquo;t the lack of signal, but the lack of people who are familiar with them. comScore estimates around 14 million people have scanned a QR code, but that&rsquo;s actually only about 6.2% of US mobile users.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWant to know more about creative ways to use QR codes?

They are people like my husband who throw away earned reward money by not using it in time. The drug store chain said that both sites now feature new humorous videos showing shoppers all the ways they can remember to not be a &quot;MoneyTrasher.&quot;&nbsp; To add to the success of the campaign, shoppers can declare their commitment against &quot;MoneyTrashing&quot; by taking a digital pledge to not be a MoneyTrasher. The first 500,000 pledge registrants will automatically receive $2 ExtraBucks rewards.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt won&rsquo;t end there.&nbsp; CVS/pharmacy customer relationship management VP Melissa Studzinski hinted at another phase of the campaign where customers are enlisted to teach their friends and family to stop &#39;trashing&#39; their ExtraBucks rewards, too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy poking fun at MoneyTrashers, guilting them into using their earned rewards, and using peer pressure, I expect CVS/pharmacy&nbsp;sees a spike in store sales as people are reminded not to waste their hard earned dough.&nbsp; Further more, the campaign supports continued customer loyalty in a very competitive market with multiple drug stores in just about every neighborhood in the US.&nbsp; Kudos to CVS/pharmacy for the creativity!</p>\r\n	t	2011-11-07 14:40:34	\N	2011-11-07 14:40:34	2013-10-11 16:57:45.986288	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Lynn Vitello, pharmacy, CVS, Money Trashers, campaign, digital campaign, advertising, rewards, Retailing Today, Melissa Studzinkski

Knowing this, it&rsquo;s important to practice and implement digital strategies for driving in-store sales. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow can you drive in-store sales during this critical time period? We&rsquo;ve released our list of digital strategies for driving in-store sales, just in time for the holiday season. Here is a preview:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Think local:</strong> According to NRF, US Census data indicates that approximately 75 percent of all US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of home. By reaching potential customers at the neighborhood level with digital campaigns, retailers can get much more targeted and serve the right ads to the right customers, driving traffic and sales.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leverage highly relevant data to proactively move inventory:</strong> Retailers are often focused on selling excess &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; inventory before the New Year. Leverage digital campaigns and neighborhood targeting technology (such as our offering) to create highly-customized advertising that reaches qualified audiences to drive in-store sales of products that may create excess inventory. This approach also helps reach the last minute shoppers who have run out of time to purchase gifts online in the final 72 hours of the holiday shopping season.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; demand:</strong> Most advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive traffic to stores. By creating a highly-localized digital campaign, brands, retailers and restaurants of any size can easily create and execute a campaign to drive &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; demand for their products or services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPractice these strategies and take some of the stress out of meeting revenue projections for the year. By developing highly-customized local digital advertising strategies, retailers and brands can effectively drive in-store sales.</p>\r\n	t	2011-11-02 13:33:27	\N	2011-11-02 13:33:27	2013-10-11 17:05:56.522902	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, press release, holiday shopping season, in-store sales, retailers, local advertising, local digital advertising, digital strategies, digital, local, NRF

As significant as those numbers are, more impressive is how online stacks up against traditional media when it comes to the affluent.&nbsp; First, that group spends a relatively low 17.6 hours per week watching TV and 7.5 hours per week listening to the radio.&nbsp; Each of those numbers represents roughly half of the time spent by the population generally.&nbsp; Putting these numbers together illuminates one of the study&rsquo;s key findings:&nbsp; the difficulty of reaching the affluent with traditional media is completely reversed when advertisers leave the airways for the Internet.&nbsp; Of course, this insight does not even account for the increased ability to target specific markets online, which far exceeds any attempts to do the same using traditional media.</li>\r\n\t<li>Digital ads work on the affluent.&nbsp; Affluent users recalled seeing an average of 21.1 digital ads in the past seven days.&nbsp; Even more impressive, 55% of affluent users identified that digital ads had created an awareness of new products, compared to 49% of the general population.&nbsp; Affluent users particularly over-indexed for their awareness of banner ads, with 80% recalling exposure to a banner ad in the previous seven days.&nbsp; Importantly, 59% of users recalled taking action as a direct result of a digital ad in the past 6 months, including an impressive 17% of affluent users visiting brick-and-mortar retail locations in response to an advertisement seen online.</li>\r\n\t<li>Affluent users like seeing ads targeting them.&nbsp; Being &ldquo;too targeted&rdquo; is not a major concern among affluent users, who do not significantly over-index when asked if they have been made uncomfortable by advertising targeting them online.&nbsp; In fact, the affluent actually greatly over-index when asked if they would be willing to share some personal information.&nbsp; Finally, and perhaps most importantly, affluent users tend to value advertising relevant to them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean for marketers?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarketing executives are always seeking ways to reach affluent consumers and their tremendous buying power.&nbsp; Using traditional media outlets and advertising methods, these wealthy consumers are notoriously hard to reach.&nbsp; However, in a reversal of their relative position in traditional media use, the affluent are online more and are more engaged with online activities than the general population.&nbsp; This represents a huge opportunity for marketers.&nbsp; By shifting traditional advertising dollars to online platforms and tailoring advertising campaigns to reach the affluent, advertisers can reach an elusive and highly desirable segment of the market like never before.</p>\r\n	t	2011-10-24 14:55:05	\N	2011-10-24 14:55:05	2013-10-23 17:01:24.692548	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Morgan Mueller, online advertising, digital, traditional advertising, campaigns, Ipsos Mendelsohn, internet usage statistics

Fortunately, retailers and brands can now quickly and easily create &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; demand to help meet their revenue projections.</p>\r\n	<p>The final 72 hours of the holiday shopping season are the most critical when it comes to meeting revenue projections for the year. Fortunately, retailers and brands can now quickly and easily create &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; demand to help meet their revenue projections. The key here is flexibility &ndash; which you have with digital channels. Most advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive traffic in stores. By creating a highly localized digital campaign, brands, retailers and restaurants of any size can easily create and execute a campaign to drive &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; demand for their products or services. Not only does this meet demand during the holiday season, but can be quickly executed at any time of the year (unlike non-digital options which require long lead times). <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, if in-store sales are slow, organizations can create campaigns that incentivize local customers to come in and make purchases. Here are some examples:<span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> In the case of a local restaurant, let&rsquo;s say they happen to have a surplus of seafood they need to use. They can quickly and easily &ldquo;turn on&rdquo; a local, digital ad campaign, advertising seafood specials to help drive traffic to their restaurant a specific day of the week.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Retailers:</strong> If a retailer, say a sporting goods store, is having a slow week and they want to drive traffic to their store on a Tuesday, they can send out a digital promotion around a store event targeting neighborhoods around their store full of interested and qualified shoppers. For example, they can encourage shoppers to gear up for March Madness and let them know their favorite NCAA team apparel is on sale and there will be chances to win prizes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Brands:</strong> Now let&rsquo;s consider brands. For example, if a potato chip brand has extra inventory a particular week at a local store, they can launch a digital campaign with a coupon for that specific store to help boost sales of their chips.&nbsp; This can also be done on a national or regional scale.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe flexibility of the digital channel allows for unique, local customization that should be taken advantage of. You can create just-in-time demand every single week of the year quickly and effectively by using a highly localized digital campaign.</p>\r\n	t	2011-11-28 14:26:13	\N	2011-11-28 14:26:13	2013-10-03 00:21:09.855699	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, digital, digital campaigns, campaigns, holiday, holiday shopping, retail, local, local campaigns, "just-in-time" demand

Even though the shopper ends up making the purchase in the store, the decision making begins online &ndash; cue digital advertising.</p>\r\n	<p>Most consumers prepare a list before shopping - it is rarely a spontaneous event. For many, much thought and planning goes into preparing for every shopping trip. Nowadays, the path to purchase starts online with shoppers beginning their purchasing experience by completing online research to compare prices, quality and reviews from other shoppers. Even though the shopper ends up making the purchase in the store, the decision making begins online &ndash; cue digital advertising. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsumers most often have a specific retailer/brand location in mind before heading out on a shopping trip. If a product or category from that retailer/brand is not on the list, consumers do not venture to those locations. The logical venue to turn to is online advertising where organizations can reach these consumers and target them with more accuracy. Don&rsquo;t let shoppers simply rely on web browsing to make their decisions. They are already there doing the research, so give them a digital ad to help drive them in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTargeted digital campaigns result in a more engaging and relevant experience for consumers. For example, digital advertising has had significant impact for CPG brand sales. According to a <a href="http://www.comscore.com/" target="_blank">comScore</a> study, 70% of online display ad campaigns generated double-digit sales lifts, and 40% of online display ad campaigns generated sales lifts of 30% or more for brands. It&rsquo;s the continuing exposure to campaigns where consumers already spend time that increases brand salience and sets the stage for purchase decisions at the store level. As more consumers turn to online before shopping, digital campaigns can build awareness and influence the decision-making process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, the beauty of building an online advertising campaign is within the metrics. You will quickly know if an ad is working and if not, you can easily and quickly make adjustments to make it more effective. So, what are you waiting for? Reach those pre-store planners before they make purchasing decisions. Move your customers from on-screen to in-store to drive in-store sales efficiently and effectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClick <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on digital advertising offerings.</p>\r\n	t	2011-12-12 14:15:11	\N	2011-12-12 14:15:11	2013-10-03 00:00:08.745962	50	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, digital, digital advertising, pre-store planning, targeted digital campaigns, campaigns, in-store, online, shopping, path to purchase, comScore

Finally, we used a composite score that consisted of a variety of holiday interests including &ldquo;holiday recipes,&rdquo; &ldquo;holiday decorating,&rdquo; &ldquo;best holiday movies&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the perfect Christmas gift,&rdquo; to compile the top 10 list.

(And we all know that when conversion rates are involved, these are the best insights to have!) By dividing your traffic between two versions of your concept or creative, you can see which one solicits the desired response from your audience - whether that&#39;s a click, sign up, or any other action. Marketers and designers are already widely using this valuable tool and here are some tips that will help you make sure you&#39;re getting the most from your A/B tests.<!--more--></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Test both versions at the same time.</strong> As with all experiments, results are best compared against a solid control. Simultaneously testing your versions - usually a current concept against a new concept - will ensure that your results are accurate and not a reflection of an outside cause.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Closely monitor your statistics but don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions too early.</strong> Set a time frame up front for your test and stick to it. The timeframe will depend on the length of the campaign, but it&#39;s best to give your campaign at least a week to run before running a test. Web traffic varies over the course of a week so this is a way to get the truest results. Ending the test too early can mean that you miss some valuable learnings,but ending it too late means that you have wasted time when you could have had your most effective version firmly in place.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Be open-minded.</strong> A/B tests can have some surprising results. While something may not strike you as pleasing to the eye, it may still be really effective at soliciting a response from your audience. While it can be hard, let the test do the decision work for you - and remember, it&#39;s results you are after!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Create a unified experience for your users, even during the test.</strong> If you are changing a button or even a whole visual concept, it&#39;s important that they see that same treatment throughout the rest of their interaction on your site or within your ad. Not only does this prevent skewing of your test results, it also gives your audience a good brand experience, even during the test period.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nInterested in reading more about A/B Testing and how to best utilize it for creating results for your campaign?

This year, advertisers are taking digital to a new level by re-thinking targeting and localizing their advertising campaigns. If local isn&rsquo;t a part of your 2012 digital advertising strategy yet, here are a few reasons why it should be. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Reinforces a local brand presence.</strong> A recent <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/" target="_blank">eMarketer</a> report stated, &ldquo;In the past, a combination of mass media and traditional local advertising was enough to drive consumers towards a national brand&rsquo;s local store or service.&rdquo; Nowadays, retailers and brands realize that this is not enough and look to online local advertising to reinforce a local presence. A consistent brand message adds value but shoppers in different geographic locations want different things. Reinforce the local presence and meet local consumer needs by reaching them through localized campaigns. Localized advertising campaigns can be targeted to a specific geographic location, making sure the local brand message is being received by the right audience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Reaches relevant consumers.</strong> According to US Census data, approximately 75% of US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of home, meaning that 50 percent of the nation&rsquo;s GDP is dependent on consumers buying locally. Localized campaigns will reach the audience that matches the exact shopper profile criteria of a local store. In addition, consumers most often have a specific retailer or brand location in mind before heading out on a shopping trip. If a product or category from that retailer or brand is not on the list, consumers do not venture to those locations to buy those brands. Turn to local digital advertising to reach these consumers and target them with more accuracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Drives in-store sales.</strong> According to a recent report from <a href="http://www.comscore.com/" target="_blank">comScore</a>, online digital campaigns drive a 21% increase in offline store sales. By serving relevant, local digital ad campaigns, retailers and brands are reaching consumers with the interest and buying power that live nearby the local stores. Furthermore, you will quickly know if an ad is working and if not, you can easily and quickly make adjustments to make it more effective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information on localized advertising, click <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\r\n	t	2012-01-11 14:44:00	\N	2012-01-11 14:44:00	2013-10-02 14:26:22.307188	50	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, 2012, local, localized advertising, 2012 advertising plans, advertising, digital advertising, digital, retail, brands, relevant consumers, eMarketer, comScore

According to the survey, six months later, the percentage usage among Hispanics doubled and still continues to grow. In addition, Hispanics tripled eReader penetration between November and May. More on the survey <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008524" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Strong buying power:</strong> The buying power of US Hispanics is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2015 &ndash; a cumulative increase of around 25%. In addition, while some Hispanic shoppers still indicate that they are price-sensitive, they are starting to show changes in shopping behavior. These changes include fewer going straight to sales items, fewer buying favorite brands and more making decisions at the shelf.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Receptive to digital messaging:&nbsp;</strong> In 2011, Hispanics appeared less responsive to in-store messaging (messaging at shelf or in-store TV) than non-Hispanics.

It&rsquo;s the time of year to relax with friends and family and enjoy good food and holiday sweets. Unfortunately, this ignorant bliss eventually comes to an end with the beginning of a new year. Seconds are scrapped and lists are made with resolutions to have a healthy new year.

Here are some tips: <!--more--><span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Launch wellness programs:</strong> Many retailers are starting to spread good health by offering wellness program packages to in-store shoppers. These programs allow shoppers to redeem points at the checkout and get discounts off prescriptions and other health items in the store. For example, <a href="http://www.riteaid.com/" target="_blank">Rite Aid</a>&rsquo;s wellness program allows shoppers to personalize and keep track of their health and weight, collecting discounts on select items as well.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Offer healthy food options at discounted prices:</strong>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank">Walmart</a> makes a conscious effort to help shoppers stay healthy by making healthier choices more affordable, saving customers $1billion per year on fresh fruits and vegetables.

By providing healthier options for shoppers, you can keep those in-store shoppers on track with their 2012 resolutions to stay fit and healthy.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Display health tips:</strong>&nbsp; Lastly, hang displays with health tips or healthy recipes for shoppers and use displays to point shoppers towards healthier food items.

Here&rsquo;s a look back at some of the major strides made in digital in 2011. &nbsp;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Digital became integral part of advertising strategies</strong>: In the beginning of 2011, <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/AboutUs/Bios.aspx" target="_blank">David Hallerman</a>, eMarketer principal analyst commented, &ldquo;as consumers continue to increase their time spent online and as the resurgent economy continues to bolster ad budgets, we&rsquo;re going to continue to see an influx of dollars toward the internet.&rdquo; And&hellip;we sure did! More advertisers and brands re-considered online advertising as a way to effectively reach consumers. In 2011, online ad spending was expected to reach $31.3 billion, a 20.2 % increase over 2010 spending. By 2015, online advertising is expected to make up nearly 28% of all US media ad spending. More <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008431" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Video:</strong> In the past year in particular, online video adoption has begun to grow at a rapidly increasing rate &ndash; 28% of media buyers expected to see the greatest increase in ad spending in the online video category for 2011. According to an <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">eMarketer</a> report, the spending for US online video advertising spending grew 52.1% to $2.16 billion, up from $1.42 billion in 2010. Its unique interactivity helps marketers more accurately measure the relationship between video ads and their influence on consumers. In June, we were pleased to announce our video targeting solution enabling digital advertisers to target their pre-roll and in-banner video ads at a neighborhood level, reaching up to 90% of online users across high-quality and brand-safe content sites.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Mobile:</strong> Mobile web adoption began to pick up rapidly towards the end of 2011 with the continued advance of smartphones and tablet acquisition &ndash; US mobile ad spending already expected to grow 47% in 2012, reaching $1.8 billion. Search and display emerged as the dominant mobile ad formats. More stats <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008666" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Localized campaigns:</strong> This past year, there has been an increasing amount of buzz around local and localizing advertising campaigns to drive in-store traffic. As US Census data indicates that approximately 75 % of all US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of home, advertisers understand that localization needs to become a key part of the brand strategy.

At this year&rsquo;s annual <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/aboutces.asp" target="_blank">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, it became clear that technology such as, tablets, smartphones, and notebooks &ndash; to name a few &ndash; are offering new advertising channels and creative ways to reach and engage with target audiences. And, as advertisers explore these channels, they need to first understand the technology behind them. For instance, advertisers should take time to understand technology adoption rates, how technology is consumed and how new technology is being marketed. Below is a look at a few insights around the emerging technologies of 2012, referencing takeaways from the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Smartphones:</strong> The key to new technology is understanding how content will be consumed. This year, smart mobile devices are predicted to become one of the leading media consumption platforms. With a wide variety of smart, interconnected mobile devices, consumers will expect content to be on-the-go and easy to access.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Tablets:</strong> <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/research/" target="_blank">Forrester Research</a> estimates that the current &ldquo;single digit penetration&rdquo; of tablets will increase 3-to-4 times by 2015 and with it, maturation of its usage expected. It is valued across all consumer groups, with Hispanics and Asian-Americans leading as the early adopters of the tablets. In addition, tablets are the first device that can easily travel with the shopper through the complete path to purchase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Tech Audience:</strong> At the CES show this year, one of the panels addressed how technology marketing is distinct for each sex. According to James McQuivey, principal analyst at Forrester Research, &ldquo;tech marketers traditionally focus on 25 to 40 year old men.&rdquo; However, according to data compiled by retailer HSN, more women actually buy tech products than men. Understanding your true consumer can have tremendous consequences for how tech products are marketed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat can you take away from the above? With the emergence of new technology, advertising opportunities can extend throughout the entire path to purchase,&nbsp; engaging with your consumers in new and unique ways. If you understand the technology, keep in mind how content is consumed, who your audience really is, the best way to engage with your audience and how to optimize campaigns across these new formats; then you will be on your way to digital success this year.</p>\r\n	t	2012-01-30 15:12:03	\N	2012-01-30 15:12:03	2013-10-01 20:00:52.552941	50	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Consumer Electronics Show, CES, digital, technology, advertising, digital advertising, 2012, smartphones, tablets, consumers, James McQuivey, Forrester Research

According to a recent RSR (Retail Systems Research) <a href="http://maxpoint.com/rsrreport" target="_blank">research study</a>, retailers have struggled to create relevant, &ldquo;local&rdquo; experiences. Shoppers in different geographic locations have different consumer needs and retailers and brands have focused on maintaining a consistent national brand look and feel, neglecting localization efforts. In 2012, how can retailers localize their digital advertising campaigns to reach the right shoppers, serve relevant ads and still maintain a national brand look and feel? Below are a few things to keep in mind. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Local matters:</strong> Retailers often struggle with engagement opportunities with consumers. According to Nikki Baird, managing partner at Retail Systems Research, &ldquo;retailers increasingly have to drive traffic across more channels with communication tools that reach smaller groups of consumers, albeit potentially in a more targeted way.&rdquo;&nbsp; By localizing advertising campaigns, ads can still have scale (reaching many consumers, not just a small group) at the local level, serving relevant ads to consumers who meet your local store&rsquo;s shopper profile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Localized advertising solutions:</strong> Targeted campaigns result in more engaging and relevant experiences for your customers. At MaxPoint, we delve deep into a wide variety of data sources to pinpoint neighborhoods where your qualified audience lives.

MaxPoint Interactive&rsquo;s Executive Team Talk blog posts explore diverse topics, sharing insights from our CEO, Joe Epperson, COO, Gretchen Joyce, and CTO, Kurt Carlson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis blog post shares insight from Joyce and Carlson on mobile devices and whether or not they are better suited for customer acquisition or customer redemption. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMobile gives retailers and brands an incredible opportunity to reach customers in a uniquely personal, targeted and cost-effective manner. Customers can redeem coupons instantly with targeted advertisements, gain rewards with mobile loyalty programs or sign-up for a store&rsquo;s e-newsletter. The opportunities are endless.&nbsp; And with mobile adoption rates on the rise, there&rsquo;s no denying that mobile is slowly making its way into the advertising plans of retailers and brands everywhere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, before implementing an advertising plan, retailers and brands need to decide mobile&rsquo;s role in the advertising strategy. More specifically&hellip;will mobile devices be better suited for customer acquisition or customer redemption? Here is what Joyce and Carlson had to say on mobile&rsquo;s role with acquisition and redemption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Joyce, mobile, in general, is a fairly new channel and sees its current benefits in helping create additional awareness for a brand with the ideal final state being redemption. However, the challenge to mobile is finding a way to make it work for redemption within stores. For example, when it comes to redeeming mobile coupons, stores are not yet equipped with systems that make it easy for redemption to truly work. Once this issue is addressed though, there lies a huge opportunity for mobile to reach already engaged customers and then prompt them to redeem something once in-store &ndash; becoming clear that mobile devices are better suited for customer redemption opposed to customer acquisition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we just mentioned, retailers and brands have a huge opportunity to reach shoppers with mobile coupons.&nbsp; A recent Exposure2 report shows that mobile coupon redemption rates often exceed 50%, while paper coupons typically have a redemption rate of only .2 &ndash; 2%. Why? It is immediate redemption, in real-time. The print rate or cut-out rate might be high for print coupons but it&rsquo;s easy to leave these behind, often forgetting to go back to your printer to pick-up the coupons. This is where mobile comes in, because who doesn&rsquo;t have a phone everywhere they go? &ndash; Joyce comments. The phone is a convenient way to receive a coupon and provides easy access when it is time to redeem in-store. All you have to do is scan right at the register or simply show the cashier the coupon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of mobile selectivity, mobile users had to have previous interaction with a retailer or brand to get a coupon on their phone. This is very compelling to advertisers because you can mail a coupon to anyone, but whether you can get them to do anything with it is hard &ndash; with mobile you can pick people who are most inclined to react, comments Carlson, greatly increasing the number of people who will actually redeem the coupon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, where coupons end, offers exist.&nbsp; Joyce comments earlier that the challenge to redeeming coupons is the hardware needed in-store. Retailers and brands can use apps, emails and/or notifications to let shoppers know about offers or sales for the day. This catches shoppers en route to the store, in the store and is super easy! Today, most shoppers plan before heading in-store, using their mobile phone to look up daily deals, sales and offers. What&rsquo;s great about this is that smartphones allow shoppers to access the Internet anywhere, so shoppers can be reached at their homes, en-route to the store, or in-store. Utilize mobile to reach shoppers on the path-to-purchase by reaching them with offers when they begin the decision making online.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, mobile users are selective. When it comes to receiving messages from retailers and brands, mobile users already know what will or will not interest them. A mobile user that is already a shopper and engaged with a retailer or brand, is most likely already headed in-store, and more likely to redeem an offer by that retailer or brand. According to Carlson, mobile allows retailers and brands to reach already acquired customers and then provide convenience for them to redeem something in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, like any new channel, there are still questions to be answered. For instance, stores must train employees on mobile coupon redemption and have the hardware set up to redeem coupons via scanners. But one thing remains clear, wherever mobile is headed, it will be better suited for customer redemption as opposed to customer acquisition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgree? Disagree?

However, to erroneously assume retail stores are going entirely by the way of digital books with the inevitable closing of brick-and-mortar stores, is a bit shortsighted.&nbsp; With a little innovation, there is still a huge profit potential in their neighborhood retail locations without losing sight of the importance of the online market.&nbsp; They are, in fact, two very different yet important sales channels.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble are more than just a place to buy books, they are a cultural phenomenon that goes beyond print material.&nbsp; The need to buy books for gifts or for reading to a group of children is still very real.&nbsp; I know this firsthand, as I received a last minute invitation to read at my son&rsquo;s preschool class as a mystery reader.&nbsp; I frantically shopped for a book to match their weekly theme. I did not have time to order it online.&nbsp; Not to mention some people will never give up the feel of a real book or magazine.&nbsp; And what about book signings?&nbsp; True, authors can &ldquo;digitally&rdquo; sign an eBook, but it is just not as meaningful.&nbsp; There is validity with a personal introduction to the author, to connect with them and to potentially buy more of their work.&nbsp; There is a human interaction that you simply cannot get online.&nbsp; Bookstores also provide a social scene as a meeting place for coffee, book clubs, study groups, budding musical artists and author lectures, all of which provide the brick-and-mortar store plenty of unique money making opportunities that cannot be made online.&nbsp; It is up to the company to think of their stores beyond a place to buy books and enhance the in-store experience to bolster profits and redefine a culture that spans the vast differences in the current generations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is not to say that stores aren&rsquo;t making a wise choice to push eBooks.&nbsp; They make a lot of money and it is quickly becoming the preferred reading method for many age groups (and I am an avid eBook reader myself).&nbsp; Retailers are, in essence, wisely diversifying their potential customer portfolio.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is huge opportunity to drive in-store sales via digital kiosks where a visitor can purchase and download eBooks with perhaps an off-line only incentive to visit their neighborhood store.&nbsp; No one says customers can&rsquo;t bring their digital reader into a store and read in one of the cozy alcoves with oversized chairs.&nbsp; And, while they are there, it gives them an opportunity to browse other books and magazines and have a cup of coffee or tea.&nbsp; Who knows, if the store provides the opportunity, they may also catch a visiting author with whom they may not otherwise have been familiar, or a live acoustic soloist, or they may bump into a friend, or find a potential date.&nbsp; The opportunities could be endless and profitable if planned and marketed correctly.</p>\r\n	t	2012-01-23 16:31:44	\N	2012-01-23 16:31:44	2013-10-01 20:08:25.948445	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Lynn Vitello, retail, in-store traffic, neighborhood, online shopping, bookstores, Barnes & Noble, Borders, sales channels, online, Ereader, tablet, book sales, digital kiosks

However, it was not until later in 2011 where companies and advertisers, not consumers, started seeing the benefits of the tablet in its value for reaching and engaging with target audiences, getting ready for a big 2012. Below are a few reasons why.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>High adoption rates:</strong> <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/research/" target="_blank">Forrester</a> estimates that the current &ldquo;single digit penetration&rdquo; of tablets will increase 3-to-4 times by 2015 and with it, maturation of its usage expected. It is valued across all consumer groups, with Hispanics and Asian-Americans leading as the early adopters of the tablets. According to a recent<a href="http://www.emarketer.com/" target="_blank"> eMarketer</a> report, Hispanics and Asian-Americans are very eager to close the technologically gap, which is a great opportunity for retailers and brands to reach these shopper groups digitally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Redefining the path-to-purchase:</strong> In a recent <a href="http://www.retailwire.com/discussion/15720/braintrust-query-how-tablets-could-revolutionize-the-shopper-path-to-purchase" target="_blank">report</a> by Retail Wire, analysts stated, &ldquo;the tablet is the first device that can actually travel with the shopper through the complete path to purchase.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inherently a mobile device, shoppers being the path to purchase by researching for coupons and other items to pick up in-store. Meanwhile, advertisers can begin to reach these shoppers online by advertising on the tablet.&nbsp; In a recent report by RetailWire, analysts say the tablet then continues to travel the path as shoppers may take it en-route with tablet shopping lists and some applications even assist shoppers during their shopping trip based on their preferences/list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Valuable in-store assistance:</strong> More and more stores are adopting digital technologies in-store to attract and engage shoppers, tablets included.

Yet, at the same time, it&#39;s never been more critical for marketers to break the code.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dodd also added, &ldquo;This is the time to make sure multicultural is at the forefront of everything we do.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDefining &quot;Hispanic&quot; or any other multicultural demographic must go beyond language, country of origin and even DMA.&nbsp; It must also include a way of life&mdash;socially and economically as well as a mental connection with each targeted area.&nbsp; In other words, connect with interests and way of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoledad O&#39;Brien, acclaimed special investigations correspondent for CNN &mdash; whose mother is African-American and Cuban, and father is Australian and Irish &mdash; said there&#39;s a tendency to want to cast a wide net around a specific group of people, such as Hispanics. &quot;Where we go wrong is aiming at stereotypes instead of reality,&quot; she noted.&nbsp; &quot;If you&#39;re looking for solutions, it&#39;s a community question,&quot; she said, stressing that authenticity comes only from truly understanding the community one is trying to reach.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, supermarket chain Food Lion performed market surveys and a lot of data analysis to develop a Hispanic program for its stores. The program, which started as a five-store pilot in the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area, has since been expanded to 63 stores, according to the grocer&#39;s Hispanic marketing manager, Daniel Herrara.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHispanic-specific programs are a must, he said, because &quot;when you try to translate general market programs to the Hispanic market, you are viewed as non-Hispanic.&quot; For Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion, a division of the Delhaize Group, loyalty rewards programs tailored specifically to Latinos have done well. Past programs rewarded customers who reached a set purchase limit with phone cards or PIN numbers. Food Lion cited in-store sampling as an effective tool as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy taking the time to truly understand the audience you want to target, like Food Lion did with their custom programs, you will have greater success with your marketing programs.&nbsp; Everyone knows that a one size fits all approach does not work well &ndash; especially in marketing, so go beyond the surface level and dive deep into the many campaign targeting and data sources available today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for visiting the OnPoint Blog!

For the early birds, here are some things to keep in mind when planning back-to-school digital campaigns in 2012:</p>\r\n	<p>Back-to-school is a big business, with nearly $69B in sales at stake. That makes it the second-biggest selling season next to the winter holidays, as well as a huge marketing period for brands and retailers.&nbsp; However, unlike the holidays, retailers can rely on shoppers to head in-store for back-to-school because parents must purchase required school supplies or new school clothes &ndash; giving retailers a huge opportunity to focus on marketing to get shoppers to buy their brands. If you are ahead of the game, back-to-school planning begins early in the New Year, making sure advertising creative is perfected to the fullest. For the early birds, here are some things to keep in mind when planning back-to-school digital campaigns in 2012: <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Reach:</strong> This back-to-school season, precisely reach the right audience online who matches your back-to-school shopper profile with localized advertising. Targeted campaigns result in more engaging and relevant experiences for customers. By localizing digital advertising campaigns, ads can still have scale (reaching many consumers, not just a small group) at the local level, serving relevant ads to relevant consumers. According to MaxPoint&rsquo;s COO, Gretchen Joyce, &ldquo;whether you are rolling out an in-stream video campaign to a targeted audience or creating a digital coupon campaign that drives shoppers to purchase multiple products at a retail location &ndash; digital localization is one of the most cost-effective and impactful ways to drive in-store sales.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHear more on localized advertising from our COO <a href="http://staging.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/2/22/what-is-the-state-of-localized-advertising-in-retail" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leverage video:&nbsp;</strong> After pinpointing the right back-to-school audience, create a strong marketing mix that doesn&rsquo;t just leverage online display but leverages online video as well. Online video advertising has quickly become a highly engaging way for retailers and brands to reach their audiences. By targeting video ads at a local level, marketers can ensure that those consumers most interested in a product and most able to buy it see the ad. For instance, leverage your back-to-school TV spots and transform them into a video ad, reaching more people for a longer period of time and for less money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRead more on online video advertising <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get your creative juices flowing, look back at these <a href="http://adage.com/article/news/top-10-back-school-ads-tech-apparel/229485/">top back-to-school ads</a> from 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Engage:&nbsp;</strong> Once you have strategized ways to target and reach shoppers, make sure your campaigns engage. For example, this back-to-school season, shoppers will head in-store but will be mindful of their budget. Try price-focused messaging to make consumers aware that you are looking out for them this shopping season. For example, J.C. Penney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smart looks for less&rdquo; message is included on many of its advertisements to remind shoppers that they keep shoppers&rsquo; budgets in mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther retailers and brands recognize that parents are not the only ones heading in-store for back-to-school but teens as well. J.C. Penney uses mobile to let teenage shoppers use a &ldquo;style mixer&rdquo; which helps them preview, mix and match outfits before making their final purchase. Others use celebrities in advertisements that really appeal to teenage consumer interests. The longer you keep shoppers engaged, the more likely your message is reinforced in their head and the more likely you are to drive in-store traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow will you bring your campaigns home this back-to-school season?

This new shift in media consumption is largely due to growth in mobile activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the surge in the mobile audience, mobile ad spending just hasn&rsquo;t kept pace with spending for other digital advertising. Perhaps the technology is too new, or organizational inertia ties up ad budgets with spending on traditional media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with such a large, engaged audience, brands can&rsquo;t afford to leave mobile out of their media plans. But just throwing money at it won&rsquo;t work either. So as mobile advertisers find their footing, we&rsquo;ve seen some clear best practices start to take shape based on our experience running a variety of mobile campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are our key tips to using mobile effectively:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Take Advantage of the Full Mobile Experience&mdash;</strong>If you want to truly engage your customers, take advantage of all the capabilities mobile offers. For example, providing a click-to-call number puts the customer on the phone with a single finger tap&mdash;a small convenience that dramatically improves the customer experience. Of course, mobile technology goes beyond click-to-call to include QR codes, mobile coupons, mobile-responsive sites, and click-to map features. Mobile is about convenience, so keep that in mind with your advertising.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Look for the Right Placement Mix&mdash;</strong>General digital advertising provides options: different banner sizes, site placements, banner animations, pre-roll video, and more. Mobile also provides the ability to target on sites or within applications. MaxPoint finds in-app ads to be highly effective, but ultimately, you have to test for what works best for your campaigns.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Skip the Cookies&mdash;</strong>Customer reach via cookie-based targeting is small on desktop advertising&mdash;it&rsquo;s even smaller on mobile. <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/7/8/perhaps-cookies-might-not-be-so-sweet" target="_blank">We&rsquo;ve mentioned it before</a>, but browsers on most mobile devices (particularly Safari on the iPhone/iPad) do not accept third-party cookies by default. This means you&rsquo;ll need to find a way to target without relying on cookies to make a real impact.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Go Easy on Geofencing&mdash;</strong>Speaking of targeting, geofencing, which involves sending a targeted message to shoppers when they&rsquo;re located within an extremely tight radius, is currently popular among mobile advertisers. But as <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/5/3/mobile-geofencing-an-advertising-trap" target="_blank">we&rsquo;ve said before</a>, geofencing simply doesn&rsquo;t scale. Effective hyperlocal advertising delivers the power of local precision while still casting a wide-enough net to give your campaign the scale that matters.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep Your Message Consistent&mdash;</strong>It&rsquo;s always important to reinforce your brand across channels, but it&rsquo;s critical when you throw mobile into the mix. Consumers frequently use their mobile devices, particularly tablets, while also watching TV or listening to the radio. Your mobile ad should support and enhance your other spots since customers are likely to be exposed to both messages at the same time.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMobile may be the new kid on the advertising block, but you shouldn&rsquo;t wait to get on the bandwagon.

The top two television events in history were the last two Super Bowl games, with the last one netting 111 million watchers.&quot;&nbsp; Add in the fact that entire groups of people are gathered together in front of a TV, attentions glued on the screen during commercial breaks, specifically for the ads!&nbsp; Taking all this into account, $3.5MM for a Super Bowl ad is a steal!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, while a Super Bowl spot will certainly buy you a wide audience, are you actually hitting the right target?&nbsp; $3.5MM may be a small price to pay in terms of reaching the most Americans, but does it pay off when it comes to efficiently reaching the specific audience for your product?&nbsp; While Budweiser may have hit their beer-guzzling 21+ male audience, did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y59VUQxX3Dk" target="_blank">Oikos Yogurt</a> or David Beckham for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQb_-OY7Z0E" target="_blank">H&amp;M</a> reach theirs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, what makes an ad effective is not just creating talk, but driving sales.

In most cases, retailers and brands are re-thinking marketing strategies this year and allocating more shopper marketing dollars for reaching shoppers at different touch points throughout the path. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a survey completed by the <a href="http://p2pi.org/" target="_blank">Path to Purchase Institute</a> in the January 2012 issue of <a href="http://www.shoppermarketingmag.com/home/" target="_blank">Shopper Marketing Magazine</a>, more dollars are being allocated to the shopper marketing budget in 2012 &ndash; as high as a 10% lift from the previous year. Originally focused on in-store marketing, retailers and brands are realizing the opportunities to reach shoppers throughout the entire path-to-purchase - constantly reminding shoppers of a brand as close to the decision making point as possible.&nbsp; So, what has changed? Let&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Smartphone/Tablet penetration:</strong>&nbsp; In the past year, adoption for smartphones and tablets has skyrocketed bringing great new features to users but new opportunities for advertisers as well. Smartphones and tablets are the first devices that can actually travel with the shopper through the complete path-to-purchase. For instance, shoppers can begin the path-to- purchase by researching for coupons and other items to pick up in-store with their smart devices before heading in-store. Shoppers can then travel the path with their devices, researching a product all the way to the store and there are even some applications that assist shoppers in-store &ndash; roughly half of all smartphone owners use devices in-store (<a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/12/07/smartphones-are-transforming-consumers-path-purchase" target="_blank">21%</a> increase from a year ago).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Pre-store planners:</strong> Most consumers prepare a list before shopping &ndash; it is rarely a spontaneous event, and includes much thought and planning in each trip. Nowadays, the path-to-purchase starts online with shoppers beginning their purchasing experience by completing online research to compare prices, quality and reviews from other shoppers. With shoppers headed online, retailers and brands can now reach these pre-store planners when they are beginning the decision making process. Understanding where to allocate money requires that marketers understand how and where purchase decisions are made, and purchase decisions now begin online &ndash; before heading in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Satisfying shopper budgets:</strong> As more shoppers are mindful of their spending, especially at the start of a new year, retailers look to revise strategies to drive these shoppers in-store. Retailers and brands meet the needs of stressed shoppers by utilizing a strong marketing mix, with focus on shopper marketing activities that still delivers a solid return on investment. If shoppers are mindful of budgets, they may not make a trip in-store and fail to see in-store marketing. However, if shoppers are reached at different touch points throughout the entire path-to-purchase, a retailer can avoid this trap.&nbsp; For example, with digital advertising, retailers can promote in-store offers and/or discounts online that are more mindful to a shopper&rsquo;s budget. Retailers may spend more to drive purchase behavior, but with digital, they have vast opportunities to reach shoppers and get the return on investment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2012, there&rsquo;s no need to guess where to spend your shopper marketing dollars &ndash; spread beyond in-store marketing and reach shoppers at every touch point on the path-to-purchase.

895	1	49	what-is-the-best-real-estate-in-mobile	What is the Best Real Estate in Mobile?	<p>When you run a mobile campaign, should you spend more on mobile web placements or in-app placements? Read today&#39;s blog post to find out.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="cell phone" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTIvMTEvMTNfMjhfNDdfNzUwX0NlbGxfUGhvbmVfaW5fSGFuZF82NzJ4NDQwLnBuZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiODAweDgwMD4iXV0/Cell-Phone-in-Hand_672x440.png" style="float:right; height:196px; width:300px" />When you think of mobile ads, you probably imagine seeing a banner ad when you go to a site like espn.com on your smartphone. And although that sort of ad is available and can be used to good effect, a lot of mobile power comes from putting relevant ads inside the apps people use on their phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re already advertising on the mobile web, you should seriously consider complementing your efforts by purchasing in-app inventory. Some <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/direct/mobile-ads-seeing-higher-click-rates-in-app-than-on-web-35283/" target="_blank">studies</a> have demonstrated that in-app placements tend to have higher click-through rates than mobile web placements. Application ads should not completely replace mobile web display, but they need to be a part of your mix. For starters:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll Get Exclusive Placement with Little Competition&mdash;</strong>The small screen size of most smartphones provides little real estate in each app for advertisements. At first glance, this might seem like a limitation, but it actually provides some key advantages for advertisers. Because most apps can handle only a single banner, every impression is front and center. Your in-app ad will receive more attention than if it were on a mobile website, where it would have to compete with other ads for attention.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll Reach More of Your Audience&mdash;</strong>According to <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/5/Introducing_Mobile_Metrix_2_Insight_into_Mobile_Behavior" target="_blank">comScore</a>, mobile users spend up to 81.5% of their time using applications. Even though users still surf the mobile web, you&rsquo;ll miss out on a lot of valuable time with your prospects by limiting your ad buys.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll Ensure a Positive Brand Experience&mdash;</strong>Despite the explosion of mobile devices, most companies still don&rsquo;t have mobile-optimized websites. This means you have to keep a vigilant eye on your mobile ad buys to avoid placing your ad on a site that might cause a negative experience for your customers. Because mobile apps are already built for the mobile experience, you know you&rsquo;ll provide your customers with an excellent user experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDespite these advantages, don&rsquo;t drop mobile web impressions from your media plan yet. Some <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2012/10/01/future-mobile-news/" target="_blank">reports</a> show that app users still prefer the mobile browser as their primary way of getting content and news. A consumer reading a news report could be more likely to purchase a related product than they would if seeing an ad on an unrelated app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, you want to make sure you have a good mix of both mobile web and application ads. Your perfect mix will depend on your audience, campaign, and current needs. The key is to test until you find the right ratio. Once you find the sweet spot, you&rsquo;ll be in the perfect position to profit from the fastest growing medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you used application-based mobile ads?

With back-to-school campaign planning beginning this month, many retailers and brands will be focusing advertising campaigns around the mom shopper. Today, we&rsquo;re here to share the following insights on the mom shopper.</p>\r\n	<p>In order to reach shoppers and drive in-store traffic, retailers need to first understand their shoppers, what they are looking for and how they are looking for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarketers have several target audience groups today and they each vary based on several variables such as location, demographics, psychographics and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, many industry professionals spend time researching and sifting through data in order to understand and effectively reach their target audience. One very popular target audience today is the Mom shopper. With back-to-school campaign planning beginning this month, many retailers and brands will be focusing advertising campaigns around the mom shopper. Today, we&rsquo;re here to share the following insights on the mom shopper. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Where Moms are looking:</strong> In 2012, meet the digital mom. Before heading in-store, <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-differences-among-teens-boomers-and-moms-new-study-findings" target="_blank">moms head online</a> &ndash; did you know that 44% of moms use social media for word-of-mouth recommendations on products and 73% feel they find trustworthy information about brands and products online? A mother&rsquo;s time is valuable and in order to manage time, mom&rsquo;s put preparation into everything. Once online, moms complete store research, find the best deals and prepare a list &ndash; they never go shopping unprepared. And, as more mom shoppers head online, the gap between traditional and digital channels is closing quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How Moms are shopping:</strong> According to Advertising Age author, Tina Sharkey, &ldquo;Motherhood triggers big changes in how women spend their time, how they consume media. <strong>And how they shop</strong>.&rdquo; Research indicates that mom shoppers use every available resource to gain a competitive, budget-friendly edge when shopping. Today, more moms are equipped and using their mobile devices when shopping. Almost two-thirds of mom shoppers have a bar code scanner app on their mobile phone. And, moms use mobile devices in-store to look up product reviews, share discounts and post online reviews.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What Moms are thinking:</strong> Whether it&rsquo;s the back-to-school shopping season or not, moms are looking for the best deals and offers a retailer has to give. In addition, when marketing to the mom shopper, keep their families in mind. Often times, moms keep their kids&rsquo; preferences in mind when heading in-store. According to a recent <a href="http://www.retailwire.com/discussion/14632/new-reality-of-marketing-to-older-moms" target="_blank">article</a> in Retail Wire, 42% of mom shoppers over the age of 35 agree that their children have a significant impact on the brands they choose.&nbsp; At the same time, 33% of these mom shoppers agreed that advertising helps them choose products as well, so really make sure you&rsquo;re marketing a product both moms and their families are interested in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you gain insight into how moms are shopping and what they are thinking, what will you do with the information?

And yes, these studies can get expensive&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t have to break your budget. In fact, there are three different styles of sales lift studies, each with their own price tags. We&rsquo;ll cover all three, including their pros and cons, so you know which one to pick for your situation.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Brand Lift Surveys&mdash;</strong>Advertising can&rsquo;t always be measured in direct dollars and cents. Building a strong brand is more a marathon than a sprint. Before the digital age, measuring such intangible, yet critical, variables as brand awareness and favorability was a matter of gathering people into a room for focus groups or paying for costly surveys from data researchers and professional interviewers. With digital advertising, a campaign&rsquo;s effect on brand perception can come into focus much more easily and cost-effectively. We&rsquo;ll cover brand lift surveys in-depth and even pull back the curtain on some of the questions MaxPoint typically asks after campaigns.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Audience Match Studies&mdash;</strong>Digital provides the biggest bang for the advertising buck by targeting audiences far more precisely than print or TV can. Because a campaign&rsquo;s success can be directly attributed to the customers reached, audience match studies measure the overall efficiency of a campaign&rsquo;s targeting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOver the next few weeks, you&rsquo;ll get the inside track on how each of these studies are run, how much they cost, and what the pros and cons are of each. We&rsquo;ll debunk a few myths while bringing the measurement landscape into crisper focus. We&rsquo;ll even draw back the curtain on some of our own campaigns and show you how we&rsquo;ve applied these studies and learned key insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned for <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/12/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-the-conundrum-of-clicks" target="_blank">next week&rsquo;s post</a>, in which we debunk a few myths about online measurement and show you why click-through rates may tell only part of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Want to Wait?</strong><br />\r\n<a href="http://offers.maxpoint.com/measurement" target="_blank">Download our free measurement guide</a> now to learn more about putting your digital campaigns to the measurement test.</p>\r\n	t	2013-09-06 13:38:20	\N	2013-09-06 13:43:13.857252	2013-10-15 13:20:21.648355	62	\N

How can you leverage local this year?</p>\r\n	<p>Retailers today are constantly looking for ways to increase their shopper marketing initiatives to reach shoppers to drive traffic and move products off the shelves. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2012, localization is becoming a key part of brand strategies. Their goal is to drive local in-store traffic to move products off the shelves by reaching qualified shoppers with localized efforts. Below are a few ways you can leverage local this year:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make Room for Localized Advertising:</strong> Incorporate digital into a shopper marketing campaign with localized advertising and reach pre-store planners. According to Forrester Research, digital is the number one medium for ages 18-44 and by 2014 the Web will be influencing $1.4B worth of in-store sales. Shoppers spend their money close to home, yet increasingly spend more time online before going to the store. Take advantage of this and target your most valuable shoppers dynamically and easily, with all of the precision and none of the waste. Read more on localized advertising <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/2/22/what-is-the-state-of-localized-advertising-in-retail" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leverage Mobile:</strong> Leverage mobile in 2012 to reach shoppers headed in-store and while in-store. For example, Hy-Vee Food Stores signed on with aisle411 to offer its mobile shoppers a way to find products in-store. The app accesses retail inventory data and floor maps to make the products available for shoppers searchable. In addition, other retailers encourage shoppers to review product prices of competitors from their phone in-store and mobile can also be used to redeem a coupon or mobile offering.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Re-think QR Codes:</strong> Just a few months ago people were still new to the concept of QR codes, but now they are everywhere. Use QR codes on in-store signage to trigger a promotional message or educate shoppers on how to use a product. It&rsquo;s equally important to continue to engage shoppers in-store as it is to engage with them online before headed to the store.

Let&rsquo;s expand. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than ever before, consumers are going online, whether it is through social networks, smartphones and/or tablets, to meet their shopper needs. According to a Deloitte&rsquo;s American Pantry study, 90% of shoppers know what they&rsquo;re buying before heading in-store and 75% of shoppers believe they are smarter shoppers than they were a year ago with the vast opportunities to complete research online. According to Jim Dudlicek, Senior Editor at Progressive Grocer, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason that grocers &ndash; either on their own or in partnership with branded companies &ndash; shouldn&rsquo;t be reaching into their consumers&rsquo; kitchens to be there when shopping lists are born.&rdquo; Cue, localized digital advertising.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrocers, fret no more. Reach shoppers before shopping lists are born with localized digital advertising. Precisely reach your audience online, within a specific store radius, and only deliver your digital ad when the audience meets the exact criteria of your shopper profile.&nbsp; Targeted campaigns result in more engaging and relevant experiences for customers. More on localized digital advertising <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/advertising-tips-and-strategies/advertising-guides-and-reports/local-approach" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, Dudlicek points out in his post, that grocers can also take advantage of the mobile/social networking experience. Connect with shoppers in store via mobile with location-based promotions and links to informative product information using product bar codes. According to Dudlicek, if online and mobile is one way to reach shoppers while preparing lists, it should be just as effective influencing impulse purchases or reminding shoppers about items they may have forgotten.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHear our COO, Gretchen Joyce and CTO, Kurt Carlson further discuss the opportunity mobile holds for retailers <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/1/25/mobile-devices-better-suited-for-customer-acquisition-or-redemption" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the opportunities that exist for retailers online today, and the increase in shoppers going online, make sure you are effectively reaching the right shoppers before they head in-store and make purchase decisions.&nbsp; Already localizing digital ad campaigns to drive in-store traffic?

Lots of planning, parties and most importantly high online chatter. And, what does this have to do with you?</p>\r\n	<p>What do the Super Bowl, March Madness and upcoming holidays like Easter and Memorial Day have in common? Lots of planning, parties and most importantly high online chatter. And, what does this have to do with you? <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Twitter, for example, famous celebrities or songs of the week are overshadowed by holiday events as the upcoming holiday becomes the trending topic. Holiday hashtags are used, holiday blog posts are written, holiday/party recipes are pinned on Pinterest &ndash; the list goes on. Fortunately for advertisers, this is a great time to reach consumers because online traffic is high. However, these months can also cause an increase in high online clutter (aka chatter) and potentially distract consumers from normal online browsing habits. No matter what time of year, advertisers can re-focus their efforts and stay visible and relevant by leveraging these three tips:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leverage video</strong>. Display or banner ads can be very effective at reaching your audience but may not stand out to the distracted consumer. Video advertising is catchy and less-likely to get missed. In addition, online habits as far as what is tweeted about and browsed for may change during these times, but many consumers still maintain other habits such as catching up on shows online. Reach shoppers with online video advertising when they tune-in to these shows. And, one thing&rsquo;s for sure &ndash; consumers watch their video. For instance, did you know consumers are watching more than 21 hours of online video per month (on average) across a variety of connected devices?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more stats on video consumption and video ad growth, click <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/2/27/what-is-contributing-to-the-rapid-growth-of-digital-video-ad-spending" target="_blank">here</a>. For more information on online video advertising solutions, click <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Revise messaging</strong>. To help avoid getting drowned out, cut through the clutter and join the conversation around a big holiday event in your advertising creative. Use keywords or messaging related to the holiday/event to catch the attention of those consumers browsing and talking about it online. If you are launching a new product or promoting a special offer, tie the holiday/event to that messaging to make it relevant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Provide incentives</strong>. If there is one way to catch someone&rsquo;s attention, it&rsquo;s through incentives. During major holidays and national events like March Madness, people are headed to stores and looking for the best deals. Party planners like to buy in bulk, so entice consumers to engage with ads by offering in-store coupons on bulk items or buy one get one free items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep the above in mind and you can reach relevant consumers and drive in-store traffic no matter what time of year it is. Get creative, get digital and drive in-store traffic.</p>\r\n	t	2012-03-12 15:43:26	\N	2012-03-12 15:43:26	2013-10-01 15:21:59.54986	51	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, campaigns, clutter, online, online campaigns, digital campaigns, digital, advertisers, video, video advertising

You have to also apply in-store marketing strategies and tactics to ensure they not only stay in the store, but that they make purchases. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to an interview in Wall Street Journal with Dina Howell, Chief Executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi X, strategic marketing in its purest form is figuring out what the consumer need is, developing an idea of meeting that need, and then getting into people&rsquo;s heads online and in the store. And, retailers and brands can achieve this by having one consistent message across different mediums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn-store marketing, specifically the use of in-store displays, is a great addition to ensure a strong marketing mix. Continue the messaging used to reach shoppers online with the same, consistent messaging in-store. In-store displays stand-out and make it easy for shoppers to find and quickly grab a product. In addition, digital displays can also help reinforce what shoppers already think they know about a product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, Best Buy stores have digital display centers with useful and informative content on their Kinect demo. Shoppers can browse for more information on the product and also test out the demo live. Not only is this informative but lets the shopper get a real feel for the product themselves. Other stores, like Walmart, also use in-store displays that tie together the ad and creative space used to reach shoppers online.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn-store displays can truly make or break a shopping experience. But remember, this is not enough alone. Pair in-store display or marketing efforts with digital advertising before shoppers head in store to ensure that you are getting the most out of your advertising efforts. In-store displays are great but ineffective if your messaging and creative aren&rsquo;t consistent with your online advertising campaign you launched to help drive them to your store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are some creative displays you&rsquo;ve seen?

Let&rsquo;s take a look at what some retailers are doing to improve waiting lines.</p>\r\n	<p>Did you know the average person waits about an hour per day in line? By the time a shopper has spent two or three minutes in line, the perceived wait time is multiplied by each passing minute according to a study by Envirosell. Shoppers get impatient quickly and choose their own line based on key indicators around them such as age of people in line, number of kids, and size of basket. Some of you may think waiting lines are only long during the holidays, but retailers know the checkout line can be long any time of the year.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo help combat long waiting lines, more and more retailers are trying new strategies to get shoppers&nbsp; through checkout faster and create a pleasant experience as they exit the store.

We all know self-checkout lanes are popular in grocery chains but more and more big-box retailers are adding them to help prevent long lines too.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Entertaining customers:</strong> Walt Disney stores distract customers in line, at peak traffic times, by entertaining customers with Disney trivia until they get to the register. &ldquo;Once they get to the register, it&rsquo;s about ensuring they have everything they need, do they need more than one bag, do they need a gift receipt, a gift certificate,&rdquo; says Paul Gainer, senior vice president of retail for Disney Store.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Placing cashiers front and center:</strong> To help shoppers tell which checkout lanes are open, Home Depot instructs cashiers to stand at the front of their registers.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Pre-scanning items:</strong> Home Depot also deploys what they call &ldquo;line busters&rdquo; as soon as they see three or more people waiting in line. Employees simply pre-scan shopping cart products before customers reach the cashier. Disney uses this approach too, which has helped their stores maintain a single-file line. By doing so, shoppers perceive the checkout process as less stressful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo further demonstrate the checkout experience to retailers, The Wall Street Journal&nbsp; shared a graphic a few months ago called, &ldquo;The Science of Lines: What&rsquo;s really happening at checkout&rdquo;.

Educated consumers spend time completing research and utilizing multiple resources to find the best deals to get the most out of their shopping experience. They are receptive to messaging and willing to learn what you have to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, how can you continue to engage and inform the educated consumer? We&rsquo;ve compiled a few tips:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Educate online.</strong> With vast online resources available, more consumers are searching and completing online research before heading in-store. Savvy shoppers will make it their business to know what they want before heading in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTailor online advertising messaging to inform shoppers about how a new product or offer is beneficial to them or provide tips on how to use a certain product. Then prompt shoppers to head in-store to learn more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Educate in-store.</strong> Shoppers may have completed online research before heading in-store but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t want to learn more once in the store. This is where customer service and effective in-store messaging is key.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake sure all employees on the floor are ready to handle customer questions and have the resources to search for answers that they may not know off-hand &ndash; for instance, if a competitor has the same product for less. In addition, use in-store displays to give shoppers tips on how to use a product or recommend products that would fit similar needs. Some in-store displays can be equipped with QR codes to direct shoppers to an online site that will answer more questions or provide an interactive element to let the shoppers get a real feel for the product. More recently, retailers are setting up displays that have an employee demonstrate how a product can be used.

This was the second of seven events in this year&rsquo;s schedule, which featured Todd Matherly, SVP of Dry Grocery, Snacks and Beverages at Sam&#39;s Club, as the key speaker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSam&#39;s Club is a retailer that many in the Rogers/Bentonville community have a strong interest in as evidenced by the 280 plus attendees that showed up for the keynote speaker. Matherly provided updates on Sam&#39;s Club within the retail landscape, sharing keys to success at Sam&#39;s Club with suppliers and helped to set suppliers&rsquo; expectations. A very interesting topic for many in the crowd was providing details on &quot;Who is the Sam&#39;s Club member?&rdquo; - which is a question everyone is constantly trying to answer when reaching the Sam&#39;s Club customer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next DBB event is less than a month away - on April 19th - with John Aden, Executive Vice President, General Merchandise, Walmart, as the key speaker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe sure to check out the MaxPoint Interactive table at the next event to learn more about how we&rsquo;re helping Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club suppliers reach their customers online and drive them in-store, to help move product off the shelf.</p>\r\n	t	2012-03-23 18:26:07	\N	2012-03-23 18:26:07	2013-09-29 18:59:08.224217	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Doing Business in Bentonville, Sam's Club

When is a good time to implement technology standards?<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;too soon&rdquo; to be standardizing within a technology. There&rsquo;s definitely a balance to maintain, but I think attempting to standardize too early on can come at the cost of threatening, or even stifling, innovation. I think there needs to be a careful balance between letting things evolve naturally, versus standardizing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a long-time developer, I have a healthy respect for technological standards. There are definitely merits to having them&mdash;they can allow technologies to interact and work together, they can grow systems, and they can certainly make development faster, even easier at times. On the other hand, standards can limit the pace at which innovation can occur. Because committees get involved in standard setting, this opens the door to various agendas dictating the specifications. The process of setting standards can introduce politics into the mix, which can put artificial limits on innovation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s no right or wrong answer. We just need to remember that as technologies grow and decisions are made, it&rsquo;s a tradeoff. Stay aware of this, and try to make the best decision for the technology.</p>\r\n	t	2012-03-21 14:14:37	\N	2012-03-21 14:14:37	2013-09-29 18:59:49.60912	52	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, technology, technology standards, IAB, Interactive Advertising Bureau

Motivate shoppers to take action after seeing your campaign by creating visuals and messages that are relevant and have value to them. Below are a few examples of campaigns that paid close attention to their target audience&rsquo;s needs when developing their campaigns.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Coke&rsquo;s cause campaign:</strong> A few months ago, Coca-Cola launched a campaign with the World Wildlife Fund to produce an all-white limited-edition can for its winter &ldquo;Artic Home&rdquo; campaign that draws attention to how the climate change has impacted the Artic habitat. Knowing that supporting causes is important to its soft drinkers, Coca-Cola appealed to its audience by raising awareness and funds (in addition to selling soft drinks) to help protect the polar bear population.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Kellogg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just Dance&rdquo; campaign:</strong> Many shoppers shop together, specifically families. And one of the reasons for this is that family&rsquo;s value the time they spend together. By understanding their audience, Kellogg&rsquo;s launched a campaign where specifically marked boxes of cereal, Pop-Tarts, and Rice Krispies Treats included codes that unlocked exclusive content in the &ldquo;Just Dance 3&rdquo; video game &ndash; a game families frequently play together. Family friendly and unity were key focuses here for this campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>French&rsquo;s mom campaign:</strong> According to a post in the March 2012 issue of Shopper Marketing Magazine, &ldquo;historically, mom is the hero during the holiday season when she uses French fried onions to make green bean casserole.&rdquo; French&rsquo;s rolled out a campaign that redesigned packaging to attract attention and started calling out recipe ideas providing mom with more French&rsquo;s coupons. For this campaign, the focus was all about mom and providing a solution for an easier, faster way to leverage French&rsquo;s during the holiday seasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what do all of the above have in common? These brands considered what mattered to their target audience and tailored messaging to meet their needs. Your audience wants to know you care about what they care about. Take some of the marketing elements above and pair with digital advertising to target the right audience online and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to campaign success!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are some creative ways you&rsquo;ve let your audience know you care?

And, if you want part of the $1.3 trillion Hispanics are predicted to spend by 2015, you must first understand the Hispanic shopper. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/1/9/understanding-the-hispanic-shopper" target="_blank">Part 1</a> of Understanding the Hispanic Shopper, we discussed some things to keep in mind when targeting the Hispanic shopper this year &ndash;including insights into their high technology adoption, strong buying power and their receptiveness to digital messaging. For part II, we will dig a little deeper and explore how Hispanics identify themselves. Why? Once you understand this, you can better tailor your digital campaign messaging and advertising efforts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a recent post written by David Morse, author at Advertising Age, &ldquo;multicultural marketers need to be mindful that race and ethnicity are, and always have been, fluid concepts&hellip;To be successful, we will need to remove our cultural blinders and anachronistic conceptions and speak the language of whatever new America is evolving.&rdquo; In other words, marketing to Hispanics five years ago should not reflect the marketing efforts being made today. Here are a few take aways from the research study on Spanish and Latin Americans referenced in Morse&rsquo;s article:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Today, only 2% of foreign-born Hispanics indicate they are non-Hispanic vs. the 12% of U.S. born Hispanics who indicate they are non-Hispanic.</li>\r\n\t<li>Intermarriage with non-Hispanics will affect how Hispanics identify or are receptive to multi-cultural messaging in years to come.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a loss of Spanish as a primary language among U.S. born Hispanics, and non-Spanish speakers are significantly less likely to call themselves Hispanic.</li>\r\n\t<li>Respondents of Latin American/Spanish ancestry who identified their race as white, black or Asian were several times more likely to identify as non-Hispanic than those who said that their race was mixed or &quot;some other race&rdquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhy is this important to know? Given that the majority of future growth in the Hispanic market will be driven by U.S. born Hispanics, it is important to understand that they will relate to their heritage differently than their parents and grandparents. According to the research referenced, Hispanics will begin to assimilate into the mainstream as future generations of Hispanics will be more likely to identify with their race vs. their Hispanic heritage. Understanding this will help you tailor your advertising messaging and make sure your marketing efforts are as effective as possible.

Below we&rsquo;ve expanded on a few of the trends we think are important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Advertise where your customers are:</strong> Shoppers today have more opportunities to decide where and when they choose to receive and interact with retailers. For instance, with the emergence of new technology, shoppers can head online via their laptop or smart devices to receive advertisements and search for retailer reviews. According to Pappas, &ldquo;the only location for retail is where the customers are.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, how can you advertise where your customers are?

Today the story is wildly different. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn December (2011), the US internet audience watched 23.2 hours of video online on average representing 43.5 billion video views.&nbsp; Meanwhile, one of every 5 American adults now owns a tablet computer, and 40% use it while watching TV (by the way, multi-screen exposure increases recall).&nbsp; If broadcasters and programmers want to reach and engage with current and potential viewers, their program promotions have no choice but to be online &ndash; it&rsquo;s where audiences live.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of the day, online video advertising doesn&rsquo;t have to be a drag on campaign resources.&nbsp; Campaigns and Super PAC operations are often harried, particularly as elections draw near.&nbsp; That said, campaigns can keep it simple, easy, and not stressful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn its most basic form, online video advertising simply means taking a :15 or :30 TV spot and putting it online.&nbsp; Take it up one level and it means adding interactivity on top of the video ad that appears as the ad plays like forms for volunteer sign ups, links to Facebook, additional video clips, and polling.&nbsp; Sound like a lot of work?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s video ad platforms can enable campaigns to add compelling interactivity in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; Video ad creation can also be outsourced to broadcasters, publishers, and platform vendors that can provide superfast turnarounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your campaign (or Super PAC) is going to invest in online video advertising, here are seven key tips to keep in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>It&rsquo;s easier than you think.</strong>&nbsp; There are plug-and-play web-based platforms out there that can help you ramp your video ad initiatives overnight and take advantage of best practices &ndash; all without incurring hassle.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Make sure you can measure campaign impact.</strong>&nbsp; Every video ad network and portal as well as Facebook provides campaign reporting.&nbsp; Clicks, percentage of video watched, etc.&nbsp; But, campaign personnel need to be able to wake up in the morning and have one unified view of campaign performance across all campaigns media buys - aka &ldquo;site by site performance.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a campaign is getting five different reports from five different media placements, it&rsquo;s not easy to gauge performance.&nbsp; Be sure to use a video ad platform that will give you all the reporting you need, all in one place, and in a way that will inform decision making.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also important to have detailed reporting such as whether or not the interactive elements in the video ad are resonating or not.&nbsp; Are viewers clicking on your Facebook link?&nbsp; Good video ad platforms provide this level of detail.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget about mobile.</strong>&nbsp; 7% of all web traffic occurs on mobile devices whether its smartphones or tablets.&nbsp; Some video ads will &ldquo;break&rdquo; on devices, including the iPad.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to use a video ad platform that will avoid breakage; that will run the same ad successfully on any screen or OS.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Target, target, target.</strong>&nbsp; Best in class video ad platforms, like MaxPoint Interactive, can enable you to target your impressions down to the neighborhood-level so that you&rsquo;re not wasting impressions.&nbsp; Some platforms can even change the message in your video &ndash; or even show different videos &ndash; based on who is watching and from where, what their political affiliation is, their gender, their age, and so forth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Buy early.</strong>&nbsp; In-stream video ad inventory can run tight at key election inflection points as can inventory on local sites where the amount of available impressions is less than on national sites.&nbsp; Also, consider not only purchasing in-stream video inventory but also in-banner video inventory.&nbsp; 250x300 in-banner video ads are particularly effective, and a good video ad platform can take a single video ad and run it simultaneously as either in-stream or in-banner just like it should be able to run the same video ad on any screen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Buy local.</strong>&nbsp; Premium local media sites &ndash; such as local newspapers, TV stations, Cable, and Radio station sites &ndash; drive higher engagement than national sites targeted to the same geographic area.&nbsp; Consider a mix of national and local.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MixpoGBImg1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2111" src="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MixpoGBImg1-300x273.jpg" style="height:273px; width:300px" title="MixpoGBImg1" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Less is more. </strong>To achieve highest average percentage of the video viewed, keeping the video ad&#39;s length shorter vs. longer is good - ideally no more than :30. Include links to additional videos for voters who want to dig in further.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MixpoGBImg2.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2112" src="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MixpoGBImg2-300x272.png" style="height:272px; width:300px" title="MixpoGBImg2" /></a></p>\r\n	t	2012-03-28 13:59:16	\N	2012-03-28 13:59:16	2013-09-27 03:27:37.486911	53	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Mixpo, video advertising platforms, political advertising campaigns, online video advertising

It reminded me that there are programming languages out there of which I&rsquo;m yet unaware, and this led me to wonder how often organizations limit themselves by staying within their programming &ldquo;comfort zones.&rdquo;</p>\r\n	<p>Recently, as I was searching online for something completely unrelated, I stumbled upon a programming language I&rsquo;d never heard of. It reminded me that there are programming languages out there of which I&rsquo;m yet unaware, and this led me to wonder how often organizations limit themselves by staying within their programming &ldquo;comfort zones.&rdquo;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake recruiting, for example. I know that some organizations discard candidates based solely on the programming languages listed on their resumes. This is short-sighted. If you&rsquo;re hiring top talent, they can learn a new language easily. Get them a syntax book and a project, and watch them go. I&rsquo;ve yet to be proven wrong on this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis limited view of language often extends further into the organization. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be about getting maximum productivity, and not just about programming in one language? Don&rsquo;t you want to pick the best tools for the job, versus saying I&rsquo;m only a Language X shop? Especially given the fact that programming languages are relatively transient, evolving over time. Fifteen years ago, C++ was considered cutting edge and a default language choice for a wide range of programming tasks. Now, it&rsquo;s only used when there is a real reason to do so, because other languages are easier and more productive. There is a reason most websites&rsquo; back ends are written in languages like PHP, Ruby on Rails, Java, or ASP.NET, and not C++. I think this is how we should look at all languages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow do you know you&rsquo;re making a good tradeoff, if you don&rsquo;t know what the other languages can do, what their strengths are? Is something else more efficient? Think of the reason there are so many container classes in languages. It&rsquo;s because there are tradeoffs. You need to know what&rsquo;s out there, and keep an open mind. By artificially limiting your work to one language, you&rsquo;re limiting your ability to innovate and expand your products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn&rsquo;t to say that your organization should add languages into your products just because you can&mdash;rather, choose a set that works for your situations, then evaluate if there are real reasons and justifications for adding others. At Maxpoint Interactive, our primary programming languages are Java, C#, and Python. But we use other languages, like C++ and Clojure, for specific parts of our system when it makes sense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bottom line is, use what will best promote productivity. Languages change and you must be able to evolve&mdash;that includes your workforce. How do you get your product implemented and out the door faster, quicker, better? That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about at the end of the day. So, why artificially limit yourself?</p>\r\n	t	2012-04-30 14:57:47	\N	2012-04-30 14:57:47	2013-09-27 02:47:24.342447	52	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, technology

Knowing this, retailers are starting to pay particularly close attention to this group and how to effectively market to the Hispanic shopper.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA recent article in the 2012 April issue of Shopper Marketing Magazine discussed how to effectively market to the Hispanic shopper, paying close attention to insights into what drives brand loyalty. Before, Hispanics were thought of as only loyal to a small niche of national brands. Deborah Garbato, contributor to Shopper Marketing Magazine, says, &ldquo;Spanish-dominant Hispanics will try new brands&hellip;according to Mercury Mambo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hispanic Shopper &amp; Retail Study&rsquo;&hellip;this erodes the notion that Hispanics are fervently loyal to a small cadre of national brands.&rdquo; So, what drives Hispanics to try new brands and become loyal customers? Here are a few insights:<span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>70% of Latinos surveyed in the Hispanic Shopper &amp; Retail Study have participated in supermarket price promotions or samplings over the past six months. 84% had never bought the item previously, and 84% had not planned on buying it.</li>\r\n\t<li>The most loyal shoppers are Spanish-dominant Latinos, however, they are hesitant to buy something they do not understand. This reinforces the importance of refining messaging and paying attention to any language barriers when marketing to this consumer group.</li>\r\n\t<li>Saving money is important to the Spanish-dominant Latinos. According to the Hispanic Shopper &amp; Retail Study, 64% of Hispanic shoppers embrace discounts, coupons and offers, and 78% of Hispanic shoppers wait to purchase a product after a promotion is over.</li>\r\n\t<li>Circulars and cause marketing also drive traffic from the Hispanic shopper. If a circular includes lifestyle content and not just pricing, Hispanics have more reason to read it. According to Garbato, &ldquo;the most relevant topics are baby care/families (39%), health (37%) and cooking (32%). As for cause marketing, 52% of Hispanics are &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to buy a brand that supports the community.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhat can we take away from this? In 2012, pay close attention to how you market to the Hispanic shopper group. Utilize offers and cause messaging to attract shoppers and gain loyalty, and make sure messaging is easily understood by the Spanish-dominant Latino.

Visuals play an important role in advertising because they appeal to a consumer&#39;s emotions and tend to be more recognizable. For example, Reis referenced a research study in 1973 where Professor Lionel Standing asked subjects to look at 10,000 images over a five day period (each image only shown for 5 seconds). When the subjects were then shown pairs of images together (images they were already shown and images yet to be seen), subjects recalled 70% of the images they had seen before. The point?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsumers read text all throughout the day and lines of text has no identifiers that separate it from one another. Reis points out that in 2010, Coca-Cola spent $267 million advertising its brand, but no one could recall the slogan. What people do remember is the &ldquo;contour&rdquo; bottle, a visual that is strongly identified with the brand to this day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith all the clutter online to distract a consumer, advertisements need to be able to catch their attention quickly.

For instance, retailers and brands like Target, Nike and Apple use strong visuals to create powerful and recognizable logos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, a visual image, while visually appealing, will have no lasting impact if it is not constantly introduced to a consumer or paired with powerful messaging.

Recognizing the importance of marketing to the Hispanic shopper, retailers and brands have focused on Hispanic specific messaging and advertising campaigns. Target Latino, a popular Hispanic marketing blog collected feedback from viewers and compiled the best Latino advertising campaigns over the past year.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe below advertisements are effective because the product and messaging appealed to the Hispanic consumer. However, advertisers also leveraged video advertising to get their ads in front of the target audience. Why? In 2011, Hispanics appeared less responsive to in-store messaging (messaging at shelf or in-store TV) than non-Hispanics. In order to reach Hispanic shoppers effectively, brands and retailers needed to move beyond these methods and find the right marketing for these consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nH2oh! &quot;Braids&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xdOoJjvr0GM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAxe &quot;Premature Perspiration&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2qD_PiZAz6k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven online ad spending predictions and consumer preference, the digital advertising route is becoming the more effective way to reach the Hispanic audience.

The interview focuses on the change in the shopper marketing path-to-purchase and recommendations for how to reach shoppers at every touch point &ndash; highlighting digital advertising. Check out the full interview below.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint</strong>: With more technology, resources and information available to shoppers these days, the shopper pathway is moving away from a simple, linear model to a highly complex, non-linear model. Retailers and Brands are now challenged with new and expanded touch points to reach and build relationships with shoppers. What are your thoughts on how marketing strategies need to change in order to reach shoppers at every touch point?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Hoyt:</strong> It&rsquo;s easy to over complicate the challenge. Like anything else, if you break it down into smaller pieces, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward. One of the big differences between traditional marketing and shopper marketing is that with shopper marketing one targets a segment of shoppers (people who want or need diapers, shampoo, a refrigerator, etc.). So instead of trying to blanket a demographic by harvesting ever greater reach or GRPs, shopper marketers hone in on the path their prospective customer is most likely to take and seek to intercept her, as often as possible with a relevant appropriate message.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProcter and Gamble likes to work with a framework that I think helps a lot. They call it &ldquo;Store-Back&rdquo;. Think about your shopper&rsquo;s journey backwards, so to speak. Start where she would encounter your product in-store&hellip; at the shelf (Packaging? Signage? P-O-P?), then move out to when she is &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; (mobile? OOH?), or at home or pre-shopping (Search? Social? Strategically placed banner ads?).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore traditional vehicles can be incorporated as well. We&rsquo;re seeing more and more consumer magazines and other media begin to describe their audiences in terms of being comprised of shopper segments and their media as offering meaningful touch points on the path to purchase. Just bear in mind, the further you get from her mission, the less direct impact your messaging will have on the ultimate purchase decision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> What marketing channels do you see being the most impactful in reaching shoppers on the path to purchase?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Hoyt:</strong> I should probably stop holding them up as the paragon of marketing virtue but again, I would point anyone who is thinking about this to consider the approaches being taken by P&amp;G. P&amp;G pretty much coined shopper marketing in its current form. They fight hard to get their messaging in-store. But retail communications is very hard to scale. If one chain is accepting and responsible about merchandising compliance, the next will be less so. P&amp;G&rsquo;s approach is to &ldquo;control what you can control&rdquo;. So they&rsquo;ve been investing very heavily in all things digital. They are successfully engaging shoppers on-line, through search, social, well-placed banners. Anywhere and everywhere she might be looking for answers or resources, they want a P&amp;G product to appear with the appropriate message.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA lot of what P&amp;G sells is targeted to younger women, often younger mothers. In this case digital is especially important. Millenials, the 18-35 year old set, use the web to find answers twice as often as Baby Boomers, and when she has her first baby, her use doubles again. Across all age groups, she is going on-line for up to 45 minutes before she goes shopping. Whether she&rsquo;s looking for value or assortment, the fact is that the primary target for most messaging directed at shoppers can be effectively reached on-line.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> Do you see digital advertising as an impactful way to reach these consumers? If so, would you recommend more shopper marketing dollars being budgeted towards digital advertising methods to reach shoppers before heading in-store?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Hoyt:</strong> I recommend that folks fish where the fish are. If your target audience is using the web to gather information, find answers, decide where to shop or what to buy, then, by all means, you should invest in a more robust digital presence. Ask a lot of questions of your customers. Only do so with a &ldquo;Store-Back&rdquo; mentality and the path will reveal itself.</p>\r\n	t	2012-05-03 13:45:34	\N	2012-05-03 13:45:34	2013-09-21 02:04:27.721681	53	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, path-to-purchase, shopper marketing, path to purchase

According to a National Retail Federation (NRF) <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1350" target="_blank">survey</a>, the average consumer celebrating the holiday is expected to spend $152.52 on gifts (up from $140.73 last year), with total spending expected to reach $18.6B. So, how are &ldquo;celebrants&rdquo; spending their money and preparing for Mother&rsquo;s Day? Let&rsquo;s take a look. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Expected Mother&rsquo;s Day Shopping Behavior</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;Americans will look for sentimental and unique ways to shower mom with affection this year,&rdquo; said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. When it comes to items to purchase and where/how to shop, consumers are well prepared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Popular items chosen for purchase:</strong> This year, consumers will spend on special meals/outings, clothing, flowers, electronics and more. According to the NRF survey, two-thirds (66.4%) will buy flowers, spending a total of $2.2B, and nearly one-third (32.8%) will treat mom to a new blouse or sweater, spending $1.6B on clothing and accessories. Those buying electronics (12.7%) will shell out a total or $1.6B, and over half (54.3%) will treat mom to a nice meal. Last but not least, consumers will spend $1.8B on gift cards and $1.3B on personal services (trip to the spa).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Where people will shop:</strong> Department stores will be packed up until Mother&rsquo;s Day as more than one-third (35.6%) of consumers will shop at a department store. If the perfect gift for mom is not found at a department store, however, consumers will head to discount and specialty stores. While shoppers will still also shop online, in-store shopping is still the most preferred way to get gifts for mom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How people will shop:</strong> With all of the new technology available to consumers today, more are headed online to complete research and prepare lists before heading in-store. Nearly 39.3% of smartphone owners and 51.2% of tablet owners plan to use their devices to research products/compare prices, redeem coupons, look up retailer information and search for the perfect gift.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetailers &ndash; expect crowds this Mother&rsquo;s Day as shoppers make room in their budget for that special gift for mom. Since shoppers are already heading online before heading in-store, make sure the ads you serve are reaching the right audience, use relevant messaging, provide Mother&rsquo;s Day shoppers with coupons, stock up on popular items, and continue to reach and cater to shoppers once in-store this Mother&#39;s Day weekend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom everyone at MaxPoint, we wish you a safe and Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day!</p>\r\n	t	2012-05-10 16:48:43	\N	2012-05-10 16:48:43	2013-09-21 02:00:04.021152	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, retail, consumers, holiday shopping, holiday, consumer spending

And, for every challenge there is an opportunity, and this year it&rsquo;s all about working &ldquo;local&rdquo; into your marketing strategy.</p>\r\n	<p>As new technology provides more opportunities for retailers and brands to expand advertising solutions across channels, they look for innovative ways to effectively target the right consumers with their marketing messages. And, for every challenge there is an opportunity, and this year it&rsquo;s all about working &ldquo;local&rdquo; into your marketing strategy.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo clarify, when we talk about local, we don&rsquo;t mean corner stores or local brands. We&rsquo;re talking about national campaigns that pinpoint consumers at the neighborhood level. For example, a car maker wants to create targeted awareness of their brand for all their buyers. Not everyone in the country is an intended buyer so the car maker needs to find a way to target a lot of people, but be smart about it. Cue a better, more efficient and more effective way to target existing and prospective customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to achieve this level of precision, companies are turning to &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions. These solutions analyze billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines.&nbsp; This data can be used to score each neighborhood and determine its interests &mdash; perhaps it&rsquo;s neighborhoods across the country with residents most interested in a healthier lifestyle, in the market for a new car or who currently use your competitor&rsquo;s product. By analyzing these data sets, companies can look at clusters of people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases, brands will use this local approach to complement an existing campaign. Targeting at the neighborhood level across the entire nation helps to curb that wasteful ad spending. By finding a relevant audience at a national level, brands can combine reach with efficiency and serve the right ads to the right potential buyers at the exact right time to create demand for a product. While most advertising programs require brands to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive interest in their product or services based on the time of year or a special event, highly-localized digital campaigns of any size can easily be created in a matter of hours by reusing digital assets to drive consumers into stores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy developing a highly-customized local digital advertising strategy that complements existing campaigns, retailers and brands can consistently and effectively drive sales that help to increase revenue and create a more personal relationship with customers.

Instead, eliminate wasted ad impressions by targeting the most interested customers in the right neighborhoods close to your local stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go Easy on Geofencing</strong><br />\r\nGeofencing targets a handful of customers only when they are near a store. On the other hand, a hyperlocal digital campaign targets crowds of ideal customers at the right time. This provides precise targeting with the scale that geofencing lacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Match Your Ads to Real-Time Weather Conditions </strong><br />\r\nProvide relevance to your ads by dynamically turning them on or off in response to weather conditions. By being highly relevant in your ad timing, and targeting the right customers, you can predict and influence what shoppers will buy in the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take Advantage of the Full Mobile Experience</strong><br />\r\nMobile is about convenience. Make it easy for customers to interact with your local business by providing click-to-call and click-to-map functionality in your ads and on your mobile-responsive site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TIMA eBook offers many other insights to improve your digital marketing, but the most powerful strategy of all is hyperlocal.

What did this reveal? According to our Interest Index report, New York ranked the highest of all U.S. cities, and its Bay Shore and Smithtown neighborhoods were most interested in purchasing brand name and generic drugs, respectively. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities that showed the greatest interest in asthma and allergy remedies include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>New York, NY</li>\r\n\t<li>Columbus, OH</li>\r\n\t<li>Casper-Riverton, WY</li>\r\n\t<li>Charlotte, NC</li>\r\n\t<li>Hartford and New Haven, CT</li>\r\n\t<li>Hattiesburg-Laurel, MS</li>\r\n\t<li>Lafayette, LA</li>\r\n\t<li>Miami-Ft.

However, our technology, which is not reliant on cookies, makes this data accessible and actionable to brands and retailers without violating consumer privacy concerns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, unlike traditional DMA targeting, brands and retailers can now target specific neighborhoods within the same DMA. For example, brands can identify neighborhoods of consumers who prefer generic versus brand name medications and tailor their message accordingly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data gleamed from this index, we implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital advertising campaigns for both pharmaceutical brands and retailers. For example:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major pharmaceutical brand was looking to increase awareness and participation in its asthma patient program by targeting areas with a high concentration of asthma sufferers. By combining DMA and interest data, MaxPoint was able to target women age 25-54 showing an interest in asthma for themselves and their families &ndash; ultimately doubling the number of program participants.</li>\r\n\t<li>A major consumer packaged goods company was interested in generating awareness and driving in-store sales of its over-the-counter cold medication. As a result of a highly targeted online video campaign, the CPG company was able to reach households with adults ages 25-54, who were interested in flu and cold remedies, and purchased competitive brands and products in the past.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor more information on this Interest Index report, click <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/online-advertising-news/asthma-and-allergy-remedy-interest" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo check out last month&rsquo;s Interest Index report on the most environmentally conscious cities, click <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/online-advertising-news/environmental-interest" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\r\n	t	2012-05-30 14:10:16	\N	2012-05-30 14:10:16	2013-11-01 21:33:53.044309	54	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, Interest Index, Digital Zip, OnPoint, data, neighborhood-level advertising, digital advertising

And, with millions of people tuning in and heading online to watch/read about the games coming this July, advertisers are taking advantage and launching campaigns that are sure to reach their target audiences.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, Coca-Cola and Visa are just two of the brands that have already started leveraging the Olympic Games and launched campaigns of Olympic size. According to Thomas Pardee, editorial/production coordinator at Advertising Age, &ldquo;Both play on the general spirit of excitement and competition while careful skirting of the international politics of games.&rdquo; Here are a few details around these campaigns:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Coca-Cola &ldquo;Move to the Beat of London 2012&rdquo; &ndash;</strong> Coca-Cola&rsquo;s campaign takes a music-based approach as Mark Ronson and singer, Katy B, are moving to the beat of the fast-paced Olympic spectacle. Aimed to engage a teenage audience and create hype around the Olympic Games, the unveiling of the campaign marks the launch of a &ldquo;Track the Beat&rdquo; Facebook app, online video spots and a &ldquo;Move to the Beat&rdquo; television commercial. In addition, the soundtrack for the campaign will play across digital/mobile platforms, during Coca-Cola events and will be available for purchase later on this year. Already, number five on the viral video chart, with over a million views, this campaign is rapidly working its way into the minds of viewers everywhere. Watch <a href="http://youtu.be/HjPHjtZ5cIk" target="_blank">here</a>. The agency behind this campaign is Mother London.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Visa &ldquo;Go World 2012&rdquo; &ndash;</strong> Visa recently unleashed its largest campaign in its 25-year history as a sponsor of the Olympic Games &ndash; leveraging TV, print and digital. The campaign features stories of Olympic athletes (Michael Phelps and Li Na for example) that highlight past glory moments, with the tagline, &ldquo;Join our global cheer.&rdquo; Already racking in more than 2.7 million video views, the campaign has generated significant social buzz across the 70 countries it&rsquo;s been released to. For the first time, Visa is leveraging social media to encourage consumer/fan participation. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/visabrand" target="_blank">here</a>. The agency behind this campaign is TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth of these brands are leveraging online video, as well as traditional methods to deliver a strong cross-channel campaign. In addition, each of these brands speaks to an audience&rsquo;s emotion, as they are focused on an event that many people have grown up with over the years. It&rsquo;s a powerful marketing mix that is expected to create a strong return on investment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther brands launching campaigns of Olympic size to watch out for are Gap, Rovio, Old Spice and Volvo (to name a few).</p>\r\n	t	2012-05-31 13:49:05	\N	2012-05-31 13:49:05	2013-09-20 00:54:57.860979	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, campaigns, online video, advertising

As a result of the post-recession economy, consumers have tried to find the best ways to maximize their monthly spend, specifically, they have become more cost-conscious grocery shoppers. Today, we&rsquo;ve released a new research report, conducted by BIGinsight&trade; that reveals the changing behavior among cost-conscious grocery shoppers as they move through the path to purchase in today&rsquo;s post-recession economy. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Grocery Industry Pulse titled, &ldquo;Reaching Today&rsquo;s Cost-Conscious Consumer,&rdquo; reveals that the average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre- to post-recession. While spending continues to climb, nearly three in four respondents have made changes to their grocery shopping habits within the last year, becoming more cost-conscious before and during their trips. Some of the ways cost-conscious grocery shoppers have changed their behavior include:<span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Shopping closer to home and shopping at multiple grocery stores</li>\r\n\t<li>Leveraging coupons and sales more</li>\r\n\t<li>Preparing lists before shopping</li>\r\n\t<li>Using more resources such as digital channels to prepare for shopping trips</li>\r\n\t<li>Heading to recipe-specific destination sites to prepare for shopping</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOther Key findings include:<span id="cke_bm_99C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Average monthly spend on groceries has steadily increased among the general population from pre-to post-recession from $250.94 in August 2007 to $277.00 in August 2011.

Why do you think you see advertisements for Christmas in July? It&rsquo;s never too early to start preparing for holidays that can rack in the largest retail sales of the year.</p>\r\n	<p>For many brands and retailers, holiday planning begins early in the year. Why do you think you see advertisements for Christmas in July? It&rsquo;s never too early to start preparing for holidays that can rack in the largest retail sales of the year.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the International Council of Shopping Centers, holiday sales in November and December can amount up to 40% of a retailer&rsquo;s annual sales. And, with this much riding on the line, retailers need to do everything they can to come out on top. Below are our top five ways to optimize your holiday campaigns this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Use relevant messaging:</strong> Holiday campaigns are typically not intended for all audiences. The product or offer being advertised is intended for a specific audience that has buying power during the holiday shopping season. Make sure messaging is relevant and speaks to your intended audience. Messaging towards parents would be much different than messaging towards teenagers, where parents may be more concerned with holiday sales and teens focused on new trends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Pair campaigns with offers/coupons:</strong> Knowing consumers will be spending a lot on different holiday decorations and gifts, it is important to keep their budget in mind. Attract shoppers in-store by offering coupons or specials in your digital holiday ads that they can download and take in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leverage localized digital advertising solutions:</strong> Above, we touched on the importance of using relevant messaging for specific audiences. However, this will not matter if your intended audience does not receive the advertisement. Leverage localized digital advertising solutions to target and serve advertisements to the relevant audience for maximum ROI. More on localized digital ad solutions <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Create cross-platform campaigns:</strong> Traditional advertising methods alone cannot deliver maximum reach, so marketers are exploring new and multiple channels to advertise on. Take creative intended for TV and repurpose it online &nbsp;such as pre/mid-roll video ads. By creating cross-platform campaigns, you can reach a wider audience and deliver on a strong marketing mix. More on cross-platform campaigns <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2012/5/9/creating-cross-platform-campaigns-what-works-what-to-avoid" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Continue to reach shoppers in-store:</strong> Once you successfully leverage online efforts and drive shopper&rsquo;s in-store, also make sure they are engaged once they get there. For instance, provide digital displays that direct shoppers to certain products seen in advertisements. This way your campaign can reach shoppers at all touchpoints on the path to purchase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s a season that defines retailers and brands, so make sure your holiday campaign is optimized to its fullest.

In addition, approximately 15 percent of survey respondents said that consumers are more frequently shopping at discount stores and club stores like Costco and Sam&rsquo;s Club.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Shopping closer to home:</strong> Local is becoming important to shoppers in 2012 as the survey also revealed that 30 percent of retail industry executives believe consumers are shopping closer to home.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Using coupons/loyalty cards:</strong> According to the survey, 32 percent of respondents said that shoppers are using more print coupons and 31 percent of respondents said that shoppers are using more digital coupons. FMI attendees (20 percent) also believe that grocery shoppers are increasing their use of store loyalty cards.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Buying more generic/private label brands:</strong> Twenty-one percent of survey respondents noted when surveyed that consumers are dealing with the changing economy by focusing purchases on buying more generic/private label brand items.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cut back on splurging and shopping for sales:</strong> Twenty percent of respondents shared that &ldquo;splurging&rdquo; on items at the grocery store has been cut back.

This week&#39;s post covers two types of studies that measure sales lift, while being more budget-friendly than panel studies.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMjkvMTBfMDdfMTlfNDI5X0Jsb2dfTWVhc3VyZW1lbnRfU2VyaWVzXzMucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Blog%20Measurement%20Series_3.png" style="float:right; height:290px; margin:0px 15px; width:300px" />In our last post, we covered <a href="http://staging.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/18/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-1" target="_blank">panel-based sales lift studies</a>. They&rsquo;re expensive and work on only the largest of campaigns. But they do provide excellent insights to the advertiser. They aren&rsquo;t your only option, however, for measuring sales lift. Today, we&rsquo;ll cover the two major alternatives&mdash;third-party point-of-sale studies and retail-partner studies. They both provide excellent data, yet are easier on your budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to recap, each of the sales lift study methods include the following steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Run a campaign to a specific test group, in an area or over a specific time frame.</li>\r\n\t<li>Collect data on both the test group and the control group.</li>\r\n\t<li>Compare the difference in sales between both groups.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe general process is always the same&mdash;it&rsquo;s the data collection step that changes. This affects both the price and the results. And that&rsquo;s where today&rsquo;s studies come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Point-of-Sale Studies</strong><br />\r\nMany stores provide research firms access to sales data in exchange for either monetary compensation or access to general industry data from the research firm. In turn, the research firm can use this data as input for sales lift studies. This relationship benefits all sides&mdash;the stores get data (or financial compensation) that they wouldn&rsquo;t get otherwise, and the firms get access to sales data that helps them complete different studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These studies are less expensive than those involving panel data. Because the data comes from stores rather than directly from consumers, however, you won&rsquo;t receive any extra information about the audience. Panel studies provide additional insights about consumers because the researchers know the exact makeup of the audience. Although you can&rsquo;t get the same insights from point-of-sale studies, they still provide accurate sales data at a decent price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Retail-Partner Studies</strong><br />\r\nRetail-partner studies are the least expensive type of sales lift study. These studies involve collecting data from your retail partners in both test stores and control stores, then comparing the lift between the two. For example, if you work with a major national retailer, you can compare the increase in sales in one region against another. Alternatively, you could compare sales during a campaign&rsquo;s run dates against a control time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retail-partner studies are great options when you want to put a dollar figure on your ad campaigns, but don&rsquo;t have the budget to spend on a study from a research firm. However, there are two major flaws with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, these studies can be skewed. Research firms typically run algorithms to correct for any over- or under-representation among their panels or store samples. For example, if young male professionals are underrepresented in a panel when compared to the ratio of the nation at large, then the third-party firm will typically count this group&rsquo;s purchases with a little more weight to compensate. Retail-partner studies don&rsquo;t necessarily correct for any demographic imbalances, making them at risk for heavy skew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, these studies aren&rsquo;t always an available option. They require that your retail partners are willing to share data with you in a timely manner. This isn&rsquo;t always the case. Additionally, you may end up picking a retail chain that has drastically skewed sales, making your results suspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you have the data available, the numbers from these studies can be an excellent ballpark for your sales figures, even if they&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sales Lift in Action</strong><br />\r\nSo, what kind of results can you expect? MaxPoint helped a major food CPG brand promote in-store sales at one of its big-box retail partners. Because the brand typically sells a high volume of products and has a fairly high measurement budget, it decided to run a panel-based sales lift study with a third-party research firm. Over three months, MaxPoint ran ads to targeted audiences in key neighborhoods around the big-box stores. After the campaign, the research firm compiled sales data from a panel to uncover the sales lift. According to the research firm&rsquo;s findings, the campaign produced a 17% increase in sales at the big-box store and a 13% increase in product sales at other retail stores. While sales lift numbers can vary widely based on the product and the industry, a 17% sales lift was a great result for this campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Next?</strong><br />\r\nThis concludes our discussion of sales lift studies. We hope you learned a lot, and now realize that you don&rsquo;t always need a huge budget to test your sales lift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if your goal is to produce an effect at a higher spot in the sales funnel?

Today&#39;s post covers some tips on how to deal with the unforeseen in digital advertising.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="Skiing" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDEvMjgvMTFfNDhfMzJfNjQ3X2lTdG9ja18wMDAwMDU5Nzg3MDBTbWFsbC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/iStock_000005978700Small.jpg" style="float:right; height:232px; margin:5px; width:350px" />When I heard that Lindsey Vonn wouldn&rsquo;t be able to compete in this year&rsquo;s Olympics, I had two reactions. First, I felt terrible for Lindsey. Imagine training for your entire life, being the best in your sport, and then having an injury sideline you when you reach the Olympics. It has to be tough, so I feel for Lindsey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second reaction was concern for the retailers and brands that would have to pull some of their ads. Imagine that you&rsquo;ve invested in campaigns featuring an Olympic athlete, only to see your main spokesperson injured for the event. Of course, many Lindsey ads will still work, but the brands will have to make judgment calls on which ads they&rsquo;ll need to pull. Regardless, this situation will likely cause some headaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sort of thing happens more often than it should. The problem goes beyond celebrity endorsement issues&mdash;it could include a brand-sponsored event that gets rained out, or it could be that a brand partner for a joint venture gets bad press. Frankly, I&rsquo;d bet good money that these situations are the leading causes of insomnia among agency employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when I started to think about it, I realized that maybe hiccups like these don&rsquo;t have to completely torpedo a campaign. There are a few preventive steps agencies can take to keep a campaign from completely collapsing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Foster a Responsive Agency Culture&mdash;</strong>It often starts with office culture. Do you encourage employees to deal well with rapid changes? And if problems arise, do cooler heads prevail? In the real-time era, it&rsquo;s paramount that agency employees feel comfortable dealing with quick changes. Encourage them now, and you&rsquo;ll have a good foundation to cushion you when you fall.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Always Have a Plan B&mdash;</strong>You will breathe easier if you have a good backup plan. In Lindsey&rsquo;s case, you could switch your client&rsquo;s campaign to cheer on all of Team USA. This keeps the campaign relevant to the Olympics, but doesn&rsquo;t focus on any single athlete.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Advertise Digitally&mdash;</strong>Digital channels provide a lot of breathing room for advertisers. Instead of scrambling to pull a print ad from a magazine issue or letting an out-of-date direct mail package reach recipients, you can swap out the creative for campaigns within 24 hours (or less).<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Consider Adaptive Campaigns&mdash;</strong>Problems frequently arise outside of issues with endorsements or bad press. Sometimes, an ad campaign can fall flat due to real-time local conditions. That&rsquo;s when a good ad technology partner can help. For example, MaxPoint runs hyperlocal digital campaigns that adapt to changing weather conditions, which means iced coffee ads on warm days and hot latte ads on frigid days. In short, smart technology leads to agile advertising campaigns.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUltimately, unforeseen events can push you off course, but they don&rsquo;t have to completely sink your campaigns. If you lay the groundwork and take a few precautions, setbacks like these will require only a few tweaks in order to right the ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you know the best audience for your Olympic-themed campaigns?

Find out why it should be if you are pursuing advertising jobs.</p>\r\n	<p><em><img alt="" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDEvMjEvMTFfNDJfMDlfOTI5X2lTdG9ja18wMDAwMTc0NTI2ODlNZWRpdW0uanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/iStock_000017452689Medium.jpg" style="float:right; height:200px; margin:5px; width:300px" />Will it play in Peoria?</em> That&rsquo;s the question advertisers have asked for years to determine whether a product, promotion, or event will appeal to mainstream America. For advertisers today, big data makes it easier than ever to answer that question. Brands are staffing their teams with professionals who know how to use the powerful insights from big data to predict if a product will play in Peoria &hellip; or Bakersfield &hellip; or Chicago &hellip; or anywhere else across the nation. So if you&rsquo;re looking to advance your career in advertising, big data should be at the top of your career development list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why Brands Like General Mills Use Big Data</strong><br />\r\nGeneral Mills&rsquo; brand pages and social channels, such as Facebook and Twitter, generate millions of customer interactions annually. Each of those interactions connects back to a consumer with a real mouth and stomach who makes decisions several times per day about what they and their family will eat. For a brand like General Mills, tapping into the insights learned from these interactions through a social media listening center provides incredible opportunity for the brand. When General Mills ties a consumer trend to product innovation faster than its competitors, it wins big in the form of greater in-store sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind, brands like General Mills are hiring experts and implementing tools to instantly aggregate and analyze data. With the right resources, they can act on microtrends related to food combinations and flavor movements extracted from online conversations. By simply listening to their consumers, brands can calculate indexes on emerging topics and tie them to sentiments. For General Mills, this means the brand can understand and act when users are excited or turned off by some product or flavor, from Cinnamon Toast Crunch to Toaster Strudels, and everything in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Big Data Is Changing the Advertising Job Market</strong><br />\r\nNever before have brands and retailers been able to chase trends and test new ideas with the same confidence and expediency.

I remember thinking, well, just run all the data. Of course at the time, access to that kind of data-crunching power wasn&rsquo;t as common as it is today. The tools weren&rsquo;t as well known, and people weren&rsquo;t in that mode of thinking. Analysts were still trained to run samples.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is something we&rsquo;re hearing a lot about. But why does it matter?

This big data now seems smaller, more manageable, more useful&mdash;more actionable. And while these tools have helped unlock these capabilities, there is a definite learning curve.

With a lot of eyeballs focused on online video, marketers must start following the trends and move more advertising dollars to online video to adapt to this consumer behavior. With digital video ad spending growing by more than 25% from 2011 to 2016, what is driving all of this growth? <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/research/" target="_blank">Forrester</a> revealed some reasons for this growth in a recent report. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what they had to say:<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Digital video content is maturing from user generated to premium content.</strong> It wasn&rsquo;t long ago, when consumers watched digital video to see stupid human tricks, cool pet tricks and even cute baby tricks, but online video is evolving today to the point where digital media companies like Hulu are producing premium original content that brands can partner with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Devices and platforms for video consumption are on the rise.</strong> Remember the days when we just watched video on a TV screen? Now it seems like devices multiplied overnight and consumers are watching digital video on computers, smartphones, and tablets. Consumers can also use new devices like Apple TV and Internet connected TVs to watch digital video. To make sure consumers can access TV content at all times, content providers are working extra hard to make this happen on a variety of devices, as long as consumers are willing to pay their cable bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Young consumers point to a &ldquo;video my way&rdquo; future.</strong> I&rsquo;m sure you aren&rsquo;t surprised to hear that a big part of this digital video growth is due to young consumers &ndash; they are leading the way in online viewing. According to Forrester, 37 million US households own a connected device that enables them to watch digital video on their TV screen. Of these households, young consumers lead the way by outpacing the overall population in adoption by almost 20 percentage points. By 2016, there will be even more opportunities for video consumption options.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s clear that digital is becoming an increasingly important part of our culture and more consumers are headed online every day. And, as consumer habits change so must advertising. So...the question remains - are you leveraging this growth and using digital video as part of your marketing strategies in 2012?</p>\r\n	t	2012-02-27 15:57:25	\N	2012-02-27 15:57:25	2013-10-01 19:05:18.219013	51	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Alicia Johston, video, online advertising, advertising budgets, Forrester, digital video ad growth, advertising statistics, consumption, consumers

And, to compete with the other clutter this time of year (graduations, weddings and the launch of summer), retailers and brands need to make sure their advertising reaches and engages the right audience.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a recent article on Luxury Daily, &ldquo;How Father&rsquo;s Day marketing differs from Mother&rsquo;s Day campaigns,&rdquo; associate reporter, Rachel Lamb, talks about how labels eyeing Father&rsquo;s Day may prefer to appeal to shoppers on the grounds of practicality and the needs and wants of the gift recipient. It is a very strategic marketing process as retailers and brands must focus on marketing gifts that appeal to dad while also getting through to moms and children - key purchasers behind Father&rsquo;s Day gifts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere are a few tips to reach and engage shoppers this Father&rsquo;s Day:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Think about the female shopper.</strong> While dads may head in-store to take advantage of Father&rsquo;s Day deals, it is most likely women who are shopping for fathers or husbands. In the article, Lamb notes that women shopping for fathers or husbands are more likely to be more creative with their purchases. Women seek out gifts for Father&rsquo;s Day that will create memories and become a keepsake. Knowing this, marketing around Father&rsquo;s Day products can highlight a product dad will enjoy but appeal to the woman receiving the ad. For instance, in your ad, be sure to talk about how the product will create a memory for dad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Understand what dad wants.</strong> This year, retailers and brands are hitting dads with luxury items, including: nice watches, cufflinks, suits and high end vehicles. Gifts around golf and other sports-related items are welcomed by dad too. Retailers and brands should be mindful of product placement around popular Father&rsquo;s Day gifts and deals making it easy for the in-store shopper to find.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leverage online advertising.</strong> Retailers and brands will be using multi-channel strategies as part of their overall Father&rsquo;s Day advertising this year. According to Lamb, &ldquo;social media and email are expected to take the reins for Father&rsquo;s Day marketing this year, but brands should consider a multi-channel attack for maximum exposure.&rdquo; Consumers are always connected and most shoppers head online to research a product or retailer/brand before heading in-store. Make sure online ads are served to the right audience when that audience begins their decision making process. With shoppers turning to digital closer to the beginning of the path to purchase, retailers and brands can leverage online advertising to make sure campaigns are delivered early and have influence. Then retailers and brands can continue to deliver advertisements and consistent messaging all the way in-store.</p>\r\n	t	2012-06-13 14:22:50	\N	2012-06-13 14:22:50	2013-09-20 00:39:09.587404	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, campaigns, advertising, multi-channel

More specifically, in addition to opening up more avenues to reach shoppers along the path to purchase, digital is causing retailers and brands to re-think and ramp up their in-store marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a recent article in Progressive Grocer, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Next For the Supermarket Circular?,&rdquo; Jason Brennan, founder of Stream Cos., discusses how in a world where everything is going digital, the printed supermarket circular is becoming counter-intuitive. According to Brennan, &ldquo;the retail circular is not necessarily dead. It just needs to be re-evaluated in the changing world of integrated, digital, mobile, and social marketing.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does this mean? In-store marketing is still an important step in the path to purchase but marketers need to make sure the in-store marketing incorporates digital strategies. To execute a clean marketing strategy from digital to in-store, retailers and brands should keep consistent with digital messaging and leverage digital in-store. Here are a couple things to keep in mind:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Incorporate digital messaging:</strong> Today, most shoppers head online to complete grocery research before they go in-store, and it can be one of the first places shoppers see an ad. Keep consistent with digital messaging on in-store displays and signage to deliver a seamless brand experience. In addition, if shoppers have seen and responded to ads online, in-store signs that incorporate digital messaging will reinforce and remind shoppers of the message.

With the advancement of new technology, devices like smart phones and tablets, allow shoppers to access mobile shopping apps. and bring digital in-store. For instance, place QR codes on in-store displays and shoppers can easily scan and access more information on a certain product. Shoppers can also access coupons or reference digital in-store floor maps from mobile devices for easier store navigation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy reaching shoppers at the beginning of the path to purchase with digital and continuing to reach them once in-store, retailers and brands can deliver a strong marketing strategy that drives in-store traffic and sales.</p>\r\n	t	2012-06-11 15:12:02	\N	2012-06-11 15:12:02	2013-09-20 00:44:54.740008	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, retail, in-store marketing, digital, digital advertising

With summer around the corner, here are a few tips to drive heightened awareness around your brand and summer deals in and out of the store to keep up with seasonal consumer needs.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Driving attention around summer deals outside of the store:</strong><br />\r\nTo engage with consumers and grab a little extra attention from your target audience this summer, give campaigns a seasonal edge and really speak to consumers seasonal needs. For example, in a <a href="http://www.progressivegrocer.com/top-stories/headlines/beverages/id35495/mikes-hard-lemonade-aims-to-do-summer-different/" target="_blank">new campaign</a> around Mike&rsquo;s Hard Lemonade, the brand recently launched a series of TV commercials that shows guys interacting in popular summer drinking occasions such as golf and fishing outings. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there &ndash; while TV ads show viewers how to &ldquo;Do Summer Different,&rdquo; a series of unique digital initiatives (video, mobile and social media) encourage consumers to decide how the promotion will play out. In addition, knowing that summer pulls in large movie crowds, Mike&rsquo;s Hard will be rolling out 15-second ad spots in more than 750 movie theaters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat can you take from the above example? Speak to consumers&rsquo; seasonal mindset by tailoring campaigns with seasonal messaging, as Mike&rsquo;s Hard launched campaigns associating their product with popular summer outings. These kinds of campaigns speak to consumers emotions and create a connection with the brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Driving attention around summer deals in-store:</strong><br />\r\nWhile it is vital to reach shoppers before they head in-store to influence purchasing decisions, it is also important to continue to reach consumers once in-store. Tie in campaign messaging with in-store displays and signage. Highlight summer deals with store-front displays that showcase the product and let shoppers know why it is a &ldquo;must have&rdquo; this summer. For instance, Mike&rsquo;s Hard could provide free samples or provide shoppers with fun summer meal ideas the drink compliments at check-out or on in-store signage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember, as always, it&rsquo;s important to know that your campaigns will reach and be received by the target audience.

See our predictions for the biggest digital shopper marketing trends you&rsquo;ll see this year.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDEvMjIvMTZfNTBfNDhfODMyX2lTdG9ja18wMDAwMjIwNzMwMTlYU21hbGwuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/iStock_000022073019XSmall.jpg" style="float:right; height:200px; margin:0px 25px; width:180px" />Shopper marketing has seen a sea change over the past few years, as the digital age put shoppers in the power seat, and retailers and CPGs must now work harder than ever to win them over. But one thing has not shifted: That is, the need for retailers and CPGs to get shoppers into stores and down the aisles in order to boost sales and category leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital tools, from e-commerce and social media to mobile, give consumers the freedom to shop how they choose&mdash;but smart shopper marketers are also using the latest in digital options to influence shopper behavior and engage them at home, on the go, and in the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are my predictions for the four biggest digital shopper marketing trends you&rsquo;ll see in 2014:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Webrooming will beat out showrooming. </strong><br />\r\nIf this past holiday season is any indication, webrooming&mdash;researching a product online before purchasing the actual item in-store&mdash;will see a boom in 2014 and virtually cancel out problems of showrooming&mdash;checking out products in the store before buying online. A <a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Consumer-Corner/2013/12/08/Webrooming-beats-showrooming-this-holiday-season/UPI-41461386500460/" target="_blank">December 2013 Harris Poll</a> found that nearly half of US consumers (46%) said they have showroomed, but more than two-thirds (69%) said they have webroomed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Hyperlocal digital advertising will hit the target.</strong><br />\r\nAll of those webroomers will influence a massive amount of sales this year: According to <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Forrester+US+CrossChannel+Retail+Sales+To+Reach+18+Trillion+By+2017/-/E-PRE6324" target="_blank">Forrester Research</a>, in-store transactions that are influenced by the web will continue to grow in 2014 and in years to come, reaching $1.8 trillion by 2017. Retailers and CPGs will be able to take full advantage of this trend through hyperlocal digital advertising, which pinpoints the right target audience with precision and at scale and delivers ads that drive purchases at the checkout counter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Mobile analytics will become even more essential.</strong><br />\r\nAccording to <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/11/comScore_Reports_September_2013_U.S._Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share" target="_blank">comScore</a>, nearly half of Americans now own smartphones. And with most consumers using smartphones while in the store, mobile has moved from an experimental shopper tool to one that is nearly status quo. In 2014, digital shopper marketers will focus heavily on mobile analytics&mdash;whether within apps or on the mobile web&mdash;to increasingly identify who customers are and provide them with targeted, personalized offers that engage them, enhance loyalty programs, and boost sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Retailers and CPGs will work to provide seamless shopping experiences. </strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s a word that&rsquo;s been floating around for the last few years, but <em>omnichannel</em> may prove to be the digital shopper marketing term of 2014 as, more than ever, consumers demand a shopping journey that is easy and consistent no matter what channel they choose&mdash;smartphone, desktop, or in-store. According to a <a href="http://money.msn.com/saving-money-tips/post.aspx?post=341fc645-31ed-4468-bd06-11c1b74bf372" target="_blank">recent study by Accenture</a>, consumer expectations may still be higher than retail capabilities in this regard, but forward-thinking retailers are testing new technologies and engagement methods that may bring the shopper&rsquo;s wish for a truly omnichannel experience to fruition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital shopper marketing has long proven that it can leverage the latest in data-driven solutions and technologies to go far beyond traditional print inserts, circulars, and in-store displays to influence and drive positive shopper behavior. I believe 2014 is going to be the year when digital and brick-and-mortar begin to truly merge and evolve into the omnichannel, personalized, targeted experience that consumers want and retailers and brands need to provide.</p>\r\n	t	2014-01-22 22:44:11	\N	2014-01-22 22:49:37.962709	2014-01-23 14:23:21.386958	50	\N

These days, customers spend more of their time online and fewer hours watching TV ads.

It is no longer enough for retailers to offer weekly deals in print at the store entrance, tucked in newspapers, or sticking out of shopper mailboxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, top retailers, such as CVS, Walgreens, Safeway, and Target, are all leading the way with the latest in digital circular offerings that are smartphone- and tablet-friendly, and tied to data-driven loyalty programs. In addition, a variety of vendors are serving up platforms and apps that pluck the original print circular out of the mailbox and send it into the digital universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Grocery Shoppers" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDIvMTcvMDhfMTNfMzdfMzU2X0dyb2NlcnlfU2hvcHBpbmdfNjAweDQwMC5wbmciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/Grocery-Shopping_600x400.png" style="float:left; height:200px; margin:5px; width:300px" />But <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/208063/" target="_blank">according to Catalina</a>, grocery stores still spend upward of 70% of their ad budgets on print, even though print circulars are not nearly as effective as they used to be (the study found that two-thirds of Memorial Day transactions, for example, contained nearly zero items promoted in the holiday circular).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Making the Most of Your Circulars</strong><br />\r\nSo how can you fully leverage the retail circular data in a much more impactful way? The answer is a powerful one-two punch: digital circulars and hyperlocal, rich media ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By digitizing your weekly circulars, you can bring your promotions to online users who prefer to check out deals on retailer websites using their desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Then, by running hyperlocal digital ads in your target neighborhoods, you can dynamically pull those promotions that are best suited for each neighborhood&mdash;meaning you&rsquo;ll reach only the audience most likely to buy and ensure that every impression contributes to in-store sales. In addition, your ads can include everything from prices and item-specific content to store locators, localized callouts, and calls to action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dynamic combo is particularly compelling because it hits three best practices for today&rsquo;s marketers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Relevancy: </strong>One circular doesn&rsquo;t fit the needs of all consumers. By running ads that respond to specific neighborhood-level interests, whether it is an offer for paper products or a discount on high-end electronics or clothing, you can know with certainty that your ads are reaching the right audience with the right offer.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Scale:</strong> It&rsquo;s one thing to find the right local neighborhoods interested in your promotions, but what about scaling an entire national campaign around specific buying attributes? Now, the technology exists to find neighborhoods across regions and around the nation that share similar purchasing attributes or behavior, so your hyperlocal campaign works in a larger, yet still highly targeted way.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> One thing is certain about traditional circulars&mdash;they are inefficient in reaching the right shoppers and expensive to produce. With digital circulars and hyperlocal rich media ads, you minimize waste by running ads for deals in only those neighborhoods that are ready, willing, and able to buy.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>Are you getting the most out of your circular?

With all of this summer fun, we decided to find the U.S. neighborhoods that are most interested in barbeque foods. Today we issued the results of an indexing study that analyzed billions of data points to determine the U.S. neighborhoods that are the most interested in barbeque foods.	We are in the heart of summer and enjoying the swimming pool, playing outside activities and grilling our favorite summer foods. With all of this summer fun, we decided to find the U.S. neighborhoods that are most interested in barbeque foods. Today we issued the results of an indexing study that analyzed billions of data points to determine the U.S. neighborhoods that are the most interested in barbeque foods.<!--more--><br/>\n<br/>\nSeattle – specifically the Wallingford and International District neighborhoods – ranked the highest, but varied in their preference for pork vs. chicken, respectively. Surprisingly, the Interest Index found the cities with neighborhoods most interested in barbeque foods are located in the Pacific Northwest, with Portland, Oregon falling right behind Seattle. Spokane, Washington ranked third.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe top 10 cities that showed the greatest interest in barbeque food include:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Seattle, WA<br/>\n2. Portland, OR<br/>\n3. Spokane, WA<br/>\n4. Missoula, MT<br/>\n5. Idaho Falls, ID<br/>\n6. Topeka, KS<br/>\n7. Phoenix, AZ<br/>\n8. Ft. Smith, AR<br/>\n9. Green Bay, WI<br/>\n10. Lubbock, TX<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find these cities, MaxPoint went beyond traditional DMA targeting and analyzed billions of data points consumed by neighborhoods across the U.S. such as offline point-of-sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages, and online magazines and recipes related to barbeque foods. MaxPoint discovered that although the demographics of the neighborhoods were identical (consumers ages 25-34 with a household income of $60,000-80,000), there are two very distinct neighborhood types when it comes to barbequing — those that prefer chicken and those that prefer pork. This information is invaluable to advertisers looking to effectively reach consumers with the right message, in the right place at the right time.<br/>\nUsing the data gleaned from this index, MaxPoint implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital ad campaigns for a variety of retailers and brands:<br/>\n<ul><br/>\n\t<li>A major chicken brand wanted to drive awareness of its chicken breast patties in 18 different markets. MaxPoint helped the company drive in-store traffic by targeting women ages 25-54, who have children ages 7-17, and who have purchased competitive chicken brands.</li>\n\t<li>A national pork brand needed to generate brand awareness and drive sales of its pork products at targeted store locations. As a result of a focused digital advertising campaign, the company was able to drive in-store sales by targeting consumers ages 35-64 who live within an 8-mile radius of each store location and who are interested in competitive brands.</li>\n</ul>\n“The results of this Interest Index were unexpected to say the least. Not only were we surprised to find the biggest barbeque food fans in the Pacific Northwest, but the data showing their strong preferences toward particular meats is both interesting and incredibly valuable to advertisers looking to market specific products,” said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer of MaxPoint Interactive. “This data shows that to reach the right consumers, advertisers need to go beyond traditional DMA targeting and understand the preferences, interests, lifestyle, purchasing habits, demographics and locations – right down to the neighborhood level – of prospective customers to increase brand awareness and drive in-store sales.”<a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MaxPointInteractive_July_Infographic_BLOG-JPG.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3022" title="MaxPointInteractive_July_Infographic_R6" src="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MaxPointInteractive_July_Infographic_BLOG-JPG-95x300.jpg" alt="" width="95" height="300" /></a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo check out last month’s Interest Index report, <a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/onpoint-blog/2012/06/28/madison-wisconsin-is-the-u-s-city-most-excited-for-the-2012-summer-olympic-games/">click here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for visiting the OnPoint blog!

The participants will include Aéropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Express, Guess, H&amp;M, Maybelline New York, Pacific Sunwear of California, Quiksilver, Staples and Vans.  Additionally, four brands sold by Procter &amp; Gamble, the nation’s largest advertiser, will be involved: Cover Girl, Olay, Pantene and Tampax.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack-to-School Saturday will be promoted in the typically enthusiastic Teen Vogue tone of voice. For instance, ads and posters will exhort, “Get ready, get set, get shopping!” And social media will, of course, play a big role; Teen Vogue has already called dibs on a hashtag, #btss.<br/>\n<br/>\n“We’re trying to create a moment of imagination and motivation,” said Jason Wagenheim, vice president and publisher of Teen Vogue, part of the Condé Nast Publications division of Advance Publications. “We saw it as a real opportunity, because for our girls, back-to-school is as important as the Christmas shopping season,” he added.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Wagenheim acknowledged that the back-to-school shopping period “is a very random 8 to 12 weeks that starts early in the South and later in the North.” But research suggested that shopping for school supplies, clothing and other merchandise “seems to peak in the second and third week of August,” he said, so the Aug. 11 date was selected as one that could be turned into “a galvanizing moment.”<br/>\n<br/>\nConsumers are becoming “increasingly interested in event-based shopping,” said Gary H. Schoenfeld, chief executive at Pacific Sunwear, who recalled how he was “up all night on Black Friday in three or four of our stores, and customers were having a blast.”<br/>\n<br/>\n“Three o’clock in the morning felt like 8 o’clock at night, as people were with friends and having a great time shopping,” Mr. Schoenfeld said. “The idea of Teen Vogue trying to introduce something like that for back-to-school is a fun idea; why not be a part of it?”<br/>\n<br/>\nWell said Mr. Schoenfeld – why not be a part of it?  You’d be truly missing out on a huge opportunity to drive in-store sales if you’re not a part of it.  Many advertisers will also use hyperlocal digital advertising targeting their customers who live within a certain mile radius of their stores across the country. With increasing pressure for companies to boost sales and profits during the back-to-school season, smart marketers will look for opportunities like this to gain that extra edge on the competition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for visiting the OnPoint blog!

For the purposes of this post, we will focus on increasing returns (specifically - conversions and landing pages).<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOptimizing your landing pages for conversions (i.e., purchasing products, downloading a white paper, signing up for a newsletter, filling out a form, clicking on some button, etc.) will ensure your marketing goals are headed in the right direction. Even seemingly &ldquo;non-conversion&rdquo; type of pages, like contact or press page, should have some underlying call to action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo how do you optimize landing pages to ensure they are converting as best they can?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to transform your website into a well-optimized conversion machine, below is the basic playbook to follow:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Define your conversion events &amp; goals:</strong> Are you selling tangible or intangible products on your site? Are you offering a webinar, downloadable white paper or e-book? It is important to figure out what you are offering and what it is worth to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Select the right tools for multivariate testing and learning:</strong> Now that you&rsquo;ve defined your conversion events and the values of these events, you can select the tool(s) that best suit your needs. For large Internet Retailers or enterprise level companies, <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/products/conversion/test-and-target" target="_blank">Adobe Test and Target</a> is hands-down the best solution. Test and Target allows marketers to optimize their websites by performing continuous testing based on any number of variables within the marketing mix matrix. For smaller companies that wish to do multivariate landing page split tests, the two popular tools are <a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=websiteoptimizer&amp;continue=http://www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/%3Fhl%3Den&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Website Optimizer</a> and <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Map your site pages to your conversion funnel:</strong> This process is fairly straightforward. Every page on a website should be assigned to one phase of your conversion funnel.&nbsp; The most basic phases of a conversion funnel are: Awareness, Decision, and Action.&nbsp; Once you do this you can then refine the messaging pages based on the funnel stage and decide which content assets should be integrated into the page content or sidebar of the site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Develop and assign media assets for each funnel stage (and pages):</strong> Most media assets will exist in some shape or form as a natural build out of the site. Typical assets range from call-to-action graphics/buttons to white papers/e-books and videos/webinars. Defining what types of assets are used for a particular stage of the funnel and assigning existing media assets allows marketers to increase engagement and facilitate movement towards a specific conversion event.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Create a testing calendar:</strong> Creating a testing calendar is simple block-and-tackling marketing. Basically, a testing calendar provides a visual of what is being tested and the duration. Laying this out in calendar format will also allow you to compare this to other concurrent activities within the company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conduct continuous testing and learning:</strong> Too many times, site owners will test too many things on given page and for too short a period of time.&nbsp; A common test is to test the placement and/or color of a call-to-action button.&nbsp; Additionally, common tests involve the wording of an offer (e.g., short bullet-listed copy versus narrative).&nbsp; There are a number of tools available that will help figure out your statistical significance.&nbsp; For example, <a href="http://splittester.com/" target="_blank">Split Tester</a> is a free tool that will report how certain you can be that two ads will perform differently over time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLanding page optimization is a mercurial process and one that cannot be done without the proper methodology AND tools. Regardless of what your site is selling or offering, following this playbook will help you better organize your plan and allow you to focus on execution and learning.</p>\r\n	t	2012-07-03 13:00:46	\N	2012-07-03 13:00:46	2013-09-19 23:54:34.378168	53	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, landing pages

Interested in the buzz generated every 4 years around this event, we wanted to find the cities most interested in the Olympic Games. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday we released the results of our June Interest Index and after analyzing billions of data points, we found that Madison, Wisconsin &ndash; specifically neighborhoods within its Middleton suburb &ndash; have the highest interest in the Olympics of all neighborhoods in the U.S.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities with neighborhoods that showed the greatest interest in the Olympics include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Madison, WI</li>\r\n\t<li>Lansing, MI</li>\r\n\t<li>Knoxville, TN</li>\r\n\t<li>St. Louis, MO</li>\r\n\t<li>Peoria-Bloomington, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, MN</li>\r\n\t<li>Des Moines, IA</li>\r\n\t<li>Washington, DC</li>\r\n\t<li>San Francisco, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Rochester, NY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo find these cities, we analyzed data consumed by neighborhoods throughout the U.S., such as offline point of sale data, social media, videos, music, local Web pages and online magazines. The company then scored each neighborhood across hundreds of topics, which cluster together indicating broader interest trends over a period of time. We used a composite score that consisted of a variety of Olympic interests including &ldquo;Team USA 2012,&rdquo; &ldquo;Michael Phelps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Olympic gymnastics,&rdquo; among a number of other specific athletes, events and related terms to compile the top 10 list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith billions of dollars in advertising spend expected around the Olympic Games this year, the results of this Interest Index go beyond the capabilities of traditional DMA targeting to reveal those U.S. neighborhoods that are most receptive to Olympic-themed campaigns. This data is invaluable for brands and retailers looking to avoid the wasted ad dollars associated with blanketed campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the research, the neighborhoods with the most Olympic spirit tend to have higher income and are well educated compared with the rest of the nation.&nbsp; Residents of the highest ranking cities typically had an average income of $80,000 per year and college educations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the data from this index, we implemented highly targeted neighborhood-level digital advertising campaigns for both brands and retailers. For example:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A major skincare brand was looking to drive in-store sales by increasing coupon downloads of its product using an Olympic athlete as its spokesperson in their creative. Using MaxPoint&rsquo;s Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology, the brand was able to drive participation by targeting neighborhoods with women aged 25-54, with a household income of $50k or higher, an active sports lifestyle and an interest in skin care.</li>\r\n\t<li>A marquee consumer packaged goods company was interested in increasing coupon downloads for its newest cereal brand.

901	1	10	move-over-showrooming-webrooming-is-here	Move Over Showrooming: Webrooming Is Here	<p>Find out how retailers can draw more webrooming consumers into stores with hyperlocal digital ads.</p>\r\n	<p>With the explosion in mobile device usage, brick-and-mortar stores have become concerned about showrooming&mdash;when consumers visit a store to research a product but subsequently buy that product online, often from a lower-priced competitor and sometimes while still in the store. It&#39;s become such an irritant that one Australian retailer <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57576395-1/store-charges-$5-showrooming-fee-to-looky-loos/" target="_blank">began charging a $5 fee</a> to consumers who came into the store and claimed to be &quot;just looking.&quot; Other retailers have countered showrooming by beefing up store-brand products, trying to make it difficult for consumers to compare private-label products to branded products online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hope for Retailers</strong><br />\r\n<img alt="woman browsing on the computer" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMDIvMDUvMTVfMzVfMTNfNzYyX1dlYnJvb21pbmdfYmxvZ183MjB4NzIwLnBuZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiODAweDgwMD4iXV0/Webrooming-blog_720x720.png" style="float:right; height:200px; margin:5px; width:200px" />Although showrooming has historically given brick-and-mortar stores cause for concern, a new survey indicates that all is not lost. A November 2013 <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/1339/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Harris Poll</a> showed that while 46% of shoppers admit to showrooming, a greater percent said that they do just the opposite: 69% percent of shoppers research a product online first and then purchase the item in the store (also known as <em>webrooming)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that mean retailers should be having a conversation about webrooming rather than showrooming? Definitely. The increasingly popular pattern of researching online and then buying in-store indicates consumers&#39; ongoing need for retailers to provide a positive in-store environment as well as a seamless omnichannel experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hyperlocal Digital Ads and Today&rsquo;s Consumers</strong><br />\r\nBy 2017, <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/12/forrester-u-s-ecommerce-forecast-2017" target="_blank">e-commerce is expected to account for just 10% of all retail sales in the United States</a>, which means the bulk of sales will continue to occur in brick-and-mortar stores. Between these retail sales predictions and the rise in webrooming, it&rsquo;s clear that consumers will continue to buy in stores, even after first researching products online. Add to that the fact that they shop close to home (with very few exceptions) and have similar purchase patterns as their neighbors, and you have a set of consumer truths that can guide you to effective advertising strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of those strategies is hyperlocal digital advertising. By using a combination of sophisticated analytics and powerful technology, hyperlocal digital advertising helps retailers seamlessly drive consumers from the online content consumption experience to the in-store purchase experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This advanced technology pinpoints the neighborhoods most likely to contain a retailer&rsquo;s ideal audience based on the content the consumers are viewing online, their demographics, their purchase histories, and more. Because consumers see the hyperlocal digital ads best matched to their interests and location, they are more likely to click on a retailer&rsquo;s website for more information, and ultimately visit the store. And it&rsquo;s once consumers come in that the transition from the online experience to the in-store experience can begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Showrooming is not quite the big bad beast we&rsquo;ve all made it out to be for the retail experience. Brick-and-mortar stores are here to stay. So, let&rsquo;s spend more time implementing the strategies that work for today&rsquo;s webrooming consumer&mdash;hyperlocal digital advertising, for example&mdash;and less time talking about showrooming, which is stacking up to be a simple distraction from the real retail story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Are you using hyperlocal digital advertising to reach the consumers most likely to buy in your stores?

The interview focuses on how to optimize ad campaigns, effective audience targeting and how to address certain industry challenges.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> Online advertising campaigns can either be very effective or ineffective at reaching and engaging with the right audience. What do you feel are the main elements an advertising campaign needs to include to achieve the campaign goal?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Mercado</strong>: In order to be effective, campaigns need an integrated approach &ndash; a central message that is being distributed through a variety of channels whether that be through social media, online advertising, traditional advertising or a combination of all. However, the challenge is to develop interesting content that will be received well by a target audience and then be able to deliver that message to the target audience. Determining the right creative and the right message is a process &ndash; it is a process of elimination and process of testing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, with the growth of new technology, advertisers can take their integrated message and then leverage targeting technology to distribute content to the relevant audience and return a strong marketing mix. If all goes well, the same message is delivered across all channels and ideally elicits a response &ndash; that means we did our job right. You also need a call to action or some sort of offer to prompt action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> What are some of the biggest challenges online advertisers face? What are some ways advertisers can address these obstacles?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Mercado:</strong> Targeting - getting the right message to the right person at the right time. That is the biggest challenge. If we serve the right message, at the right time to the right audience we should see higher results. Many of our clients want to reach a specific audience and we are forced to continuously look for more and more targeted ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, in order to find the right targeting technology, we have to keep up with and evaluate new technology. New technology is evolving and coming at us all the time, bringing new ways of finding people. We are all trying to get the right message to the right audience at the right time &ndash; that is the biggest challenge right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> How can advertisers effectively reach their target audience? Do you believe hyper-local targeting has an impact on reaching the right audience?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Mercado:</strong> Advertisers can effectively reach their target audience by leveraging hyper-local targeting solutions. AM radio and magazines can reach a lot of people but are not very targeted which is why more people are turning to digital solutions today. However, advertisers also need to create compelling messages that will engage their target audience, once reached.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe get a check mark because of our creative but we also provide a very interesting mix of media to go after a target audience. In order to effectively reach an audience, there are various stages to complete. For instance, first we need to develop the creative. Then we have to put a forecast together &ndash; how many people are going to see this, what is the CTR, guestimates on past work, past products and then try to formulate some sort of return on investment with the client.</p>\r\n	t	2012-07-16 12:21:22	\N	2012-07-16 12:21:22	2013-09-17 14:14:59.523246	58	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, online advertising, targeting

Caucasians&rsquo; buying power rose 124 percent during that period.</li>\r\n\t<li>The combined buying power of African-Americans, Asians and Native Americans was $1.4 trillion in 2007, a gain of 201 percent since 1990. Meanwhile, the economic clout of Latinos rose by 307 percent, to $862 billion, over that span.</li>\r\n\t<li>The number of African-American-owned companies rose 45 percent from 1997 to 2002 &mdash; 4 1/2 times faster than the national average &mdash; and their receipts grew slightly faster than all others. Native American-owned businesses increased by 67 percent, Asian firms 24 percent, Latino companies 31 percent.</li>\r\n\t<li>The African-American population grew 27 percent from 1990 to 2007, compared to 15 percent for Caucasians and 21 percent overall. And the percentage of multiracial citizens, though just 1.6 percent of America&#39;s 302 million people, is swelling at 10 times the rate of Caucasian population growth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf current trends continue, demographers say, nonwhites will be in the majority in America by 2042 &mdash; a prospect not lost on advertisers, says Melanie Shreffler, editor of Marketing to the Emerging Majorities, an industry newsletter.&nbsp; Marketers &quot;aren&#39;t turning out multicultural ads for the good of society,&quot; says Shreffler. &quot;They recognize there is money involved.

According to the Horowitz Associates&#39; 13th annual State of Cable and Digital Media: Multicultural Edition study, Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Asian urban consumers were asked how well TV represents racial and ethnic groups in terms of quality (accuracy in comparison with reality) and quantity (proportionate with reality). One-third (32%) said TV does a good job with quality, but a comparable number (27%) gave unfavorable ratings; two in five (40%) gave favorable ratings for quantity and one-quarter (23%) gave unfavorable ratings. Across total multicultural consumers, neutral ratings fell between 37% (quantity) and 41% (quality).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe study also showed there is much work to be done in appealing to the Asian market.&nbsp; According to the study, Asians are the least satisfied with multicultural representation, giving the lowest favorable ratings for quantity (24%; 31% unfavorable) and quality (22%; 27% unfavorable). Asians are the only segment that gave higher unfavorable ratings than favorable ratings for both quantity and quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Multicultural audiences have always been the best customers for television and entertainment. Tokenism and stereotypical representation of ethnicities in the media will not pass muster among this new general market for media,&quot; notes Adriana Waterston, Horowitz&#39;s VP of Marketing and Business Development. &quot;Our findings, particularly the dramatic differences between key segments of the Hispanic market, help underscore the value viewers place in seeing themselves represented in the stories, voices, and faces they watch on TV.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo longer can an advertiser bombard an audience with smiling Caucasian families eating around a dinner table with a view of a white picket fence outside of the window.&nbsp; Times have changed and so has the family dinner.&nbsp; People want to look into a mirror when being advertised to.&nbsp; They want the ads to relate to them as a person mentally, physically and emotionally. With that said, advertising needs to be more lifestyle focused.&nbsp; Targeting groups of individuals with commonalities across activities, income level, values and interests is now more important than ethnicity alone.&nbsp; A more holistic approach in connecting with your audience will help drive successful campaigns.</p>\r\n	t	2012-07-27 12:50:15	\N	2012-07-27 12:50:15	2013-09-17 14:24:46.779394	58	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Latino Marketing, Hispanic Marketing, Multicultural

Treat each shopper as an individual purchaser and tailor customer service to meet each individual&rsquo;s needs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Equip floor personnel with new technology so they can effectively answer customer questions. For instance, employees can use smart phones to compare prices for customers at other store locations and use apps to help shoppers navigate through the store.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nConsumers will determine the outcome of their experience with a retailer after making the final purchase in-store.

815	1	35	how-data-affects-back-to-school-shoppers	How Data Affects Back To School Shoppers	<p>In the advertising market, many companies keep gathering more information and building more detailed profiles. If that information is not current, it is often worse than having no information at all.</p>\r\n	<p>Recently I was visiting with another dad Thom as we sent our kids off on a summer mission project. We talked about what else we did for the summer: family trips, household projects, sports, etc. Somehow this summer seemed to be the bucket where every activity that could not possibly fit in the last nine months is getting shoved. It will be a relief when school starts back and the kids are in one place from 8am to 3pm.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the conversation turned to where we worked, I mentioned working for an online advertising company, and Thom told me about his recent experience online. After several searches, he started to see specific ads for an SUV he wanted. Everywhere he went online, ads would show up exactly on target for what he was looking for. The stores were just around the corner from his house in San Francisco. Companies had built an incredible profile of his shopping habits. The only issue is that he bought that SUV more than a year ago. On top of that, Thom moved to Austin from San Francisco more than 10 years ago. Here was a profile of Thom&rsquo;s life and interests that was accurate, detailed and actionable except it was out of date. These advertisers were spending money targeting a specific customer who was no longer relevant. No amount of advertising was going to get Thom back in those stores for back-to-school clothes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy experience has been similar. I went to a site that shows the information collected in my digital footprint. It had interesting details on my life like the fact that I have a kid under two and another under five. Now I understand why I get ads for diapers every now and then even though it has been a while since my son (now in college) and daughter (in high school) have needed them. Incredibly detailed, actionable data that is stale and irrelevant. By the time school starts, I will be buying a new laptop for Patrick and clothes, school supplies and probably a car for Rebecca (she loves the Toyota Matrix). Pampers are not high on that list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the advertising market, many companies keep gathering more information and building more detailed profiles. If that information is not current, it is often worse than having no information at all. These ads, most likely, were cookie-based campaigns. According to comScore, only 20% of the intended audience is typically found with a cookie-based campaign, and 30% of computers delete their ad server cookies more than four times every month. With cookie-based campaigns, you&rsquo;ll never find enough of your customers. Advertisers should focus on a combination of multiple robust data sources, such as demographics data, retail purchase data, health data and lifestyle data, to better define and locate the right audience. Make sure any information you use for your back-to-school campaigns this summer is current as well as actionable.</p>\r\n	t	2012-08-23 13:47:24	\N	2012-08-23 13:47:24	2013-09-17 14:04:53.098339	58	back-to-school, data, digital advertising, MaxPoint, OnPoint

To reach these groups &mdash; and ultimately drive traffic to retail locations &mdash; the Atlanta-based beverage company builds its marketing efforts around &quot;connection points&quot; such as functional/body, emotional/mind and cultural/spirit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it comes to attracting Latina moms, Coca-Cola&#39;s messaging has previously centered predominantly on pairing its products with meal occasions. However, the company decided instead to talk about pairing its products with home entertainment occasions.&nbsp; This is a testament to a company&rsquo;s ability to change and rapidly modify their efforts to what is most timely and relevant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLatina moms love watching telenovelas, or Spanish-language soaps, so the company created the &quot;Coca-Cola Telenovela Club,&quot; and recruited two popular serial stars to be the club&#39;s spokespeople. The program incorporates a digital platform and in-store displays.&nbsp; Within two months, the website generated more than 30 million impressions and retail outlets with the displays were reporting a 22 percent increase in Coca-Cola sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLatina moms are General Mills&#39; target as well. The company&#39;s &quot;Que Rica Vida&quot; program, which bundles many of its iconic American brands, strives to establish an emotional connection with Latinas, in turn making the products more relevant to them and their families, said Rodolfo Rodriguez, the Minneapolis-based company&#39;s director of multicultural marketing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Que Rica Vida&quot; launched in 2007 with a direct-mail magazine printed four times a year, and has grown to include grassroots promotions, a Univision media partnership, digital efforts and other strategic partnerships. The magazine continues to be a highly successful piece, with households receiving the publication generating 10 percent higher sales, Rodriguez said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRather than segment by gender, Chicago-based MillerCoors focuses its initiatives on bicultural Hispanic consumers, those who &quot;feel like a Latino, but think and dress like an American,&quot; according to Roger Garcia, brand manager for the Coors Family of Brands, Hispanic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe brewer uses the acronym SLICE to describe its Hispanic market approach:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sponsorships (ex. entertainment venues, New York&#39;s Puerto Rican Day Parade)</li>\r\n\t<li>Local markets</li>\r\n\t<li>Innovations (its newest product is aluminum pints)</li>\r\n\t<li>Culturally relevant advertising and programming</li>\r\n\t<li>Execution</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nGarcia said retail activation is vital to bringing all of these pieces together to reach the consumer. &quot;If we don&#39;t have retail displays that resonate, all of this can get lost,&quot; he noted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis point was also echoed by Marla Rappaport of Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark Corp., who said engaging consumers at retail is a key aim of her company&#39;s Hispanic program for its Scott brand of paper products.&nbsp; The Scott program is built around &quot;dichos,&quot; folksy sayings used by Hispanics in their everyday conversations. In its recent campaign, Scott asked consumers how they apply &quot;dichos&quot; in their own lives.&nbsp; The campaign was called &quot;Buen Rollo,&quot; which translated means &quot;the good roll.&quot; The company teamed with retailers such as Walmart, Kroger, Family Dollar and ShopRite, driving consumers to the stores for in-store demonstrations, samplings, a free gift with purchase, and giveaways. &quot;Buen Rollo&quot; community events also were held in various markets.&nbsp; The company saw 9 percent growth in measured markets and made 141 million impressions, exceeding its goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutumn Dawn McDonald, director, consumer insight &amp; strategy for Kraft, and Roberto Ruiz, VP, brand solutions at Univision, teamed together on using in-market testing for growth in the Hispanic market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMcDonald and Ruiz showed how a campaign based on Hispanic-specific insights helped increase sales of Kraft Singles cheese by 12 percent in the Hispanic market. &quot;The general market campaign was geared to bringing back grilled cheese sandwiches &mdash; but that message doesn&#39;t resonate with Hispanics,&quot; said Ruiz.

(Guerrilla Tactics Media), calls this the &quot;Benetton Approach&quot; since it echoes a 1980s campaign by United Colors of Benetton that pictured interracial close-ups, such as a Caucasian woman and an African-American woman hugging an Asian baby.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuch ads often depict, Carter says, &quot;a bunch of different races playing along, side by side, Kumbaya.&quot; The ads may play well now, but Carter wonders how long they will be effective &mdash; particularly as America &quot;beiges&quot; and race becomes less essential to how individuals self-identify. Over the long run, advertisers would do better, he says, to focus on a cultural approach with versatile images and campaigns easily adapted to highly individualized tastes and interests. Put another way: How do hip-hoppers feel? What are the common desires of surfers, or skateboarders, or kayakers?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPepsi appears to have digested the message. Though its &quot;Refresh Everything&quot; ads include people of multiple races, &quot;We&#39;re targeting anyone who embodies optimism and the spirit of youth,&quot; says Nicole Bradley, a Pepsi spokeswoman. &quot;It&#39;s more about a mind-set than a demographic. With young people who&#39;ve grown up in a biracially or surrounded by different cultures and races, it&#39;s more about what connects them.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommon connections and interests rather than race, give credence to the old adage &ldquo;birds of a feather flock together.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not necessarily true any longer in the US that races alone flock together.&nbsp; Rather, people and groups with similar views, tastes, beliefs, income, culture, activities and interests flock together independent of race.&nbsp; If advertisers are really serious about getting highly targeted campaigns, interest &amp; lifestyle data should be used along with a combination of other powerful data sources like consumer demographics data, health data, and retail purchase data.</p>\r\n	t	2012-08-06 23:58:17	\N	2012-08-06 23:58:17	2013-09-17 14:19:24.509944	58	MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, multicultural, latino marketing, asian marketing, aftrican american marketing

It starts by getting local. Hyperlocal, that is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the biggest concerns for brands and retailers is the idea of having to liquidate seasonal events and holidays that typically spur excess sales. In an ideal world, stores have enough of a product during the high-traffic times and an appropriately adjusted amount of inventory left in the months to follow. The supply side knows the &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; model well, but it is imperative that stores understand how to create just-in-time demand as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvaluating local digital advertising strategies will help determine the best way to drive foot traffic to nearby stores. It is an incredibly effective way to create just-in-time demand for specific products at the first signs of inventory imbalance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraditional advertising programs require brands and retailers to create campaigns weeks or months in advance of when they&rsquo;d like to drive traffic to stores. Digital changes all that. Now, brands can &mdash; and should &mdash; reuse campaign assets to launch hyper-local digital campaigns in a matter of hours. This gives marketers incredible power &mdash; no longer do campaigns need to be planned far in advance. Now, marketers can supplement planned promotions with those that drive demand at the individual store level, based on the inventory at any given location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile targeting consumers within a certain demographic in a specific DMA is common practice, retailers should be targeting consumers with specific interests within a certain mile radius from stores with excess inventory, to take that targeting technique to a far more advanced level. This requires leveraging technology that analyzes both online and offline data points and making this data actionable in a matter of milliseconds. This data is incredibly valuable, revealing the attributes of neighborhoods across the country so brands and retailers can drill down to target only those neighborhoods with residents that are a fit for their products and services, driving real traffic to specific stores, with the ability to scale nationwide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce <a href="www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">neighborhood data</a> is determined, national campaign assets can be easily customized with localized messages and the address of the nearest store location. Not only does this create a more personalized ad experience, it creates consistency across all ad elements on various media, and contributes to the ROI on the money spent on campaign creative. This is key for brands looking to maximize their ad investments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, a national craft store chain wanted to drive awareness of its back-to-school products to consumers within a 10-mile radius of specific store locations. By using demographic, point-of-sale and geographic data, the chain was able to target consumers on a hyperlocal level. It hit either a.) only female teachers, ages 25-55, with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, and a household income of less than $60,000; or b.) mothers, ages 35-55, with a household income of less than $100,000, and frequent purchasers of craft products based on past data.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHyperlocal precision takes incentives and offers to a whole new level. If in-store sales are slow for a particular item, brands and retailers can create campaigns that incentivize local consumers to come in and make purchases of that specific item.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose companies that solely run carpet-bombing national campaigns need to rethink their digital ad strategy. If building awareness is the goal, this strategy works. But if you want to move products off shelves, carpet-bombing can be irrelevant, too broad and just plain expensive. Instead, they should complement national campaigns with hyperlocal campaigns. Get local, and you will move seasonal items off-the-shelf, where and when you want.</p>\r\n	t	2012-09-17 10:45:45	\N	2012-09-17 10:45:45	2013-09-16 22:37:01.240188	58	hyper-local, neighborhoods, digital advertising, holiday marketing

I rarely look under the hood, can&rsquo;t change my own oil, and am only vaguely aware that I have a spare tire in the trunk. I would rather leave everything to professional mechanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Real-Time Insights" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTAvMDkvMTRfMDRfMDdfNTA2X1N0b3B3YXRjaF8yMDB4MjAwLnBuZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiODAweDgwMD4iXV0/Stopwatch_200x200.png" style="float:right; height:180px; width:180px" />But with digital advertising, you really should pop the hood to see what&rsquo;s powering your campaigns. For example, many advertisers rely on third-party cookies for their targeting. We&rsquo;ve covered <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/7/8/perhaps-cookies-might-not-be-so-sweet" target="_blank">the limitations of cookies before</a>, but we didn&rsquo;t mention that most purchased cookies are 90 days old by the time they&rsquo;re used. In Internet Standard Time, that&rsquo;s an eternity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to get fresher data is to use audience intelligence pixels. They provide real-time behavioral insights that you can use to drive your hyperlocal advertising response even higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me give you an example. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re pushing new shoppers to request samples for a cologne. You target your usual demographic, which is single men making over $60,000 per year. But you need to target a subset of shoppers within that demographic to find men most likely to request samples. To find them, your digital provider can place pixels on your home page and several internal pages to find the highest converting group among your organic and paid web traffic. You might discover that men in the suburbs tend to request samples online, while urbanites stick to sampling in-store. This makes it a no-brainer: target men who live in the suburbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this can go a step further. Imagine that, two weeks into the campaign, a famous quarterback mentions your brand of cologne as his personal fragrance. You will likely see sales spike in neighborhoods packed with his fans. If you&rsquo;ve pixeled the right pages, you&rsquo;ll note the traffic spike and can strike while the iron is hot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that pixels provide audience intelligence in real time in ways that third-party cookies alone simply can&rsquo;t. Adding the data available from pixels into an overall audience intelligence model will upgrade the engines currently running your digital campaigns.</p>\r\n	t	2013-10-09 19:01:57	\N	2013-10-09 19:03:55.234915	2013-10-09 19:04:43.482373	52	\N

According to an article in Mashable, &ldquo;infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data or knowledge.

According to an article in <a href="http://mashable.com/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, &ldquo;infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics represent complex information quickly and clearly, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education.&rdquo;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo how do you get started? Well, if you&rsquo;re an advertiser thinking about creating an infographic, here are some tips to keep in mind to ensure your infographic stands out from the rest:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Gather your data:</strong> Obviously, it all starts with data. Make sure you have enough data to tell your story in the form of an infographic, and don&rsquo;t lose sight of the data as you begin your design.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep the design simple:</strong> Don&rsquo;t overthink the design and make it too complicated. You want to lure your viewers in, so be sure to use a simple design that&rsquo;s easy to interpret.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Choose one topic:</strong> Be sure the story you&rsquo;re trying to tell focuses on one topic. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll end up with too many confusing visualizations.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Tell a story:</strong> Think about taking your data and turning it into a narrative. Maybe you&rsquo;ll explain a process, highlight trends on a given topic, or support some type of debate. Whatever it is, your infographic will stand out when you take a storytelling approach.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Check your facts:</strong> You will lose immediate credibility if you publish an infographic with incorrect data. It may seem obvious, but it happens. Be sure to double-check your facts and proofread, proofread, proofread!</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Consider visual approaches:</strong> Effective infographics use attractive colors, proper typography, and hierarchy techniques to keep viewers engaged.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make sure it can stand alone:</strong> A good infographic should be able to stand on its own, especially in this world of sharing online.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cite your data:</strong> With infographics containing so much data, don&rsquo;t forget to cite your sources for not only the data points but also your photos and illustrations.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Avoid using too many words:</strong> Even though you should be telling a story through the use of visuals and short phrases, don&rsquo;t write a novel. Keep your information short and to the point.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create a small file:</strong> You want readers to be able to share and download your infographic easily, so keep the size of the file small while not compromising the quality of your imagery.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThese tips will help you create an effective infographic.

Why? Lower brands aren&rsquo;t offering the quality consumers are finding in luxury brands.</p>\r\n	<p>Believe it or not, consumers are staying loyal to luxury brands even during our challenging economic times. Why? Lower brands aren&rsquo;t offering the quality consumers are finding in luxury brands. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a Global 500 study by Brand Finance, &ldquo;consumers turn to these alphabrands because they are keen to cast aside their worries about the economic downturn and allow themselves an indulgence in a brand which they know, trust and admire.&rdquo; So what are these luxury brands doing right to keep these consumers coming back for more?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLuxury brands follow not only the classic four P&rsquo;s of marketing but also the four E&rsquo;s &ndash; experience, exclusivity, engagement, and emotion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Experience:</strong> Consumers are still buying the luxury brands, but they&rsquo;re being extra selective and are asking themselves &ldquo;Is it worth it?&rdquo; Luxury brands answer this question by offering consumers an &ldquo;experience.&rdquo; For example, Burberry saw a 29% increase in revenue by switching most of its marketing budget to digital experiences. And the Ritz-Carlton has proved that investing in a quality experience will set you aside from your competition.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Exclusivity:</strong> We all know one key to a luxury brand&rsquo;s success is the exclusivity it offers, which the brand can transfer to its digital marketing. For example, the St. Regis offers an e-butler app, and Chanel offers an interactive culture microsite. It&rsquo;s this high-tech marketing that makes these luxury brands appear exclusive and on the cutting edge.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> In the luxury brand world, engagement means one thing &ndash; a story. We&rsquo;ve all cried while watching a diamond commercial that tells an engaging story, right? An appealing story that evokes emotion from consumers is key to a successful luxury brand. Tiffany &amp; Co. saw a 20% uptick in sales after its launch of the &ldquo;What Makes Love True&rdquo; microsite and &ldquo;Engagement Ring Finder&rdquo; mobile app &ndash; both of which communicate the story of realizing true love.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> The final element is emotion. Speaking to consumers&rsquo; wants is key for a luxury brand. Consumers who want to feel authentic and timeless stay loyal to brands like Burberry. They shop at Tiffany&rsquo;s to feel love, and they stay at the Ritz-Carlton to feel admired.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLuxury brands have proved that following the four E&rsquo;s is critical to their success in a slowing economy, when consumers have so many more affordable options. Marketers who are seeking to improve loyalty to their brands may want to apply the four E&rsquo;s to their strategies.</p>\r\n	t	2012-09-27 10:00:57	\N	2012-09-27 10:00:57	2013-09-16 22:31:34.240694	58	luxury, brands, marketing, advertising

filter out negative messaging and images (and focus on the positive) thanks to the amygdala &ndash; the emotional center in the brain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaroline Winnett, chief marketing officer of Nielsen Neurofocus, says &ldquo;the brain is far more adaptable than we thought. So the old paradigm that you get old and your brain and all your neurons die is completely getting shot down by new research.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a recent article in <a href="http://adage.com/" target="_blank"><em>Advertising Age</em></a>, research shows that &ldquo;while boomers have more trouble seeing the forest through the trees and often ignore busy ads or information in borders around ads, that&#39;s just because they&#39;re more easily distracted than younger folks. And that&#39;s a problem, it turns out, that a little &lsquo;World of Warcraft&rsquo; might cure.&rdquo; A recent study even showed that those over 55 saw immediate structural brain changes after exposure to a series of video games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy is this important? Well, many advertisers focus on the millennial group and tend to forget boomers, who according to Nielsen make up 25% of the US population and control 70% of the net worth of American households. <em>Advertising Age</em> recognizes the importance of marketing to boomers and recently shared some tips on understanding the differences between the boomer brain and the millennial brain. Read through these tips from Nielsen Neurofocus, and let us know your thoughts on marketing to boomers.</p>\r\n	t	2012-10-11 18:36:22	\N	2012-10-11 18:36:22	2013-09-10 16:44:52.363163	58	advertising age, nielsen, advertising, creative campaigns

This year, advertisers are stepping it up, creating viral campaigns, buying selective spots and adding digital elements.</p>\r\n	<p>As Super Bowl XLVI draws near (February 5!), smells of chili, brew and talks of Super Bowl parties are in the air - but the chatter doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Almost as exciting (if not more exciting for some) as the Super Bowl game itself, fans anticipate the select group of new advertisements shown. This year, advertisers are stepping it up, creating viral campaigns, buying selective spots and adding digital elements. Below is a preview of who&rsquo;s buying what and a look at how advertisers are using digital to reach consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Who&rsquo;s buying what?</strong><br />\r\nWith 30-second spots quickly going for as much as $3.5 million, retailers and brands are stepping up, dishing out the dollars and grabbing the spots before others can take their place. Who&rsquo;s buying what? Here&rsquo;s a sneak peak:<span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Skechers: This popular retailer has secured one spot to run just before the two-minute warning in the first half of the game. Entrepreneur, Mark Cuban will promote Skechers&rsquo; GoRun shoe line alongside a bulldog named &ldquo;Mr. Quigley.&rdquo; Watch the preview <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j87Y-NS7Evk&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Volkswagen: For this year&rsquo;s Super Bowl, Volkswagen grabs a 60-second spot that will air in the third quarter of the game. A minute-long teaser for its 2012 entry features dogs in &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; accessories barking the movie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Imperial March.&rdquo; Watch the preview <a href="http://www.thehdroom.com/news/The-Bark-Side-2012-Volkswagen-Super-Bowl-Commercial-Teaser-/10106" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bridgestone: In addition to sponsoring the half-time show this year, Bridgestone will air two related commercials about their tire performance. Watch the preview <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NjDDFIV7Z8&amp;feature=player_embedded#!" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSee the full list <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/buying-super-bowl-2012/231122/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Super Bowl embraces digital</strong><br />\r\nWe all know TV is the main channel for Super Bowl advertisements, but more advertisers are incorporating digital elements and using digital to make the ads go viral -extending beyond viewers who are simply watching during the game. With over 60% of the U.S. population using the Internet, it has proved to be an effective medium to reach and engage with consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast year, consumers and advertisers shared Super Bowl ads over YouTube &ndash; making them more viral than if they had just left it up to traditional advertising. This year, retailers and brands incorporate digital elements by adding mobile apps for consumers to interact with a campaign or play a game that ties back to the advertised product. For example, PepsiCo &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/business/media/to-promote-brisk-tea-pepsi-enlists-the-aid-of-yoda.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Star Wars</a>&rdquo; campaign has limited edition bottles and a &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; mobile game. Others use social media channels and online contests to create hype around a Super Bowl campaign, such as Doritos &ldquo;<a href="http://www.crashthesuperbowl.com/" target="_blank">Crash the Super Bowl</a>.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, Super Bowl advertisers &ndash; leverage your high priced TV creative after the Super Bowl with online video advertising. For instance, our video targeting solution enables digital advertisers to target their pre-roll video, reaching up to 90% of online users across high-quality and brand-safe content sites, including co-branded YouTube channels. Now able to target both pre-roll and in-banner video ads at a local level, marketers can ensure that the consumers most able to buy and interested in a product see the ad. Online video advertising has quickly become a highly engaging way for retailers and brands to reach their audiences, driving in-store traffic.

The trend seemed to follow the rules of the universe, maintaining the yin and yang of the advertising and consumer worlds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnter smartphones and tablets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese mobile devices single-handedly rocked the advertising world by converting men into shopping gurus! That&rsquo;s right; according to a September 2012 study conducted by online market research company <a href="http://www.usamp.com" target="_blank">uSamp</a>, women in the United States trail men in terms of mobile purchases. Men out-shop women in the consumer electronics category by nearly 20% and have significant leads in digital content, movie and event tickets, computer equipment, and luxury goods. Women, however, still hold the lead for health and beauty by a 6% margin when it comes to mobile purchases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMen also over-index for most mobile shopping activities, not just buying. The study by uSamp indicates that 91% of male mobile device users have scanned a mobile barcode, compared to 85% of female US mobile users. Moreover, almost half of male mobile users have used their mobile devices to make a payment, compared to just over one-third of females. However, female mobile users do beat out their male counterparts when it comes to the use of mobile coupons: 44% to 35%.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA mobile shopping study by digital ad agency <a href="http://www.moosylvania.com/" target="_blank">Moosylvania</a> also points to women as heavy mobile coupon users. According to its findings, 44% of female US smartphone users redeemed an online coupon via mobile in November 2011, compared to 34% of men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe same Moosylvania study also found that 32% of female US smartphone users have opted in to receive location-based mobile coupons, compared to only 26% of men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs more men become one with their mobile devices, the opportunities for advertising increase significantly. It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind, however, that men&rsquo;s advertising preferences and shopping behavior are very different from that of women. According to an <a href="http://www.iprospect.com/digital-anatomy-of-the-affluent-male" target="_blank">iProspect report</a>, for example, males show a preference for video ads over banner ads. Marketers should take note of gender differences when launching any mobile commerce-related campaigns and offers.</p>\r\n	t	2012-11-28 21:01:58	\N	2012-11-28 21:01:58	2013-09-04 15:25:22.222477	59	mobile, mobile advertising, retailers, brands, MaxPoint

With the rise of hyperlocal targeting and companies that can serve your ads online directly to a specific market, merchandisers have a golden opportunity to spend their dollars on the exact people they wish to reach.</p>\r\n	<p>It is pretty obvious by now that if you don&rsquo;t have an online component in one form or another to your advertising campaign, the likelihood of effectively reaching your target audience is slim to none. With the rise of hyperlocal targeting and companies that can serve your ads online directly to a specific market, merchandisers have a golden opportunity to spend their dollars on the exact people they wish to reach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore the hyperlocal movement, placing ads was like fishing with a trawling net. Since trawling nets are fairly indiscriminate in what they catch, you usually end up catching fish that are too small to keep or a noncommercial species that you dispose of. Sure, you&rsquo;ll get a few of the specific fish you want to catch, but the majority will be waste you throw back in, some even slipping through the holes. In fact, according to Greenpeace, trawlers frequently throw away over 30% of the fish they catch, and as much as 70% of trawl catches are wastefully dumped overboard. Today, brands that use the latest in hyperlocal targeting are catching exactly what they want with the right tools and bait for a specific audience&mdash;with very few getting away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarketing to shoppers is difficult. Marketing to male shoppers is even more so because men tend to see shopping as a tactical strike rather than a drawn-out process. Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s Gillette Fusion line is no exception to a targeted strategy aimed at men. The ProGuide Styler, designed to enhance facial hair to create an individual look, is a favorite among North American men, particularly those under 30 years old. What is the best way to reach a 20-something male? Digitally. Combine that with happy customers, and you have an online, viral campaign driving young men to snatch up the latest tool in the facial fashion trend. According to Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s research on the campaign, 70% of men who have already used the ProGlide Styler said it is better than the grooming tools they&rsquo;ve used previously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo round out its digital advertising and social media efforts, Gillette also leverages television, print advertising, and in-store merchandising. The integrated effort features rapper and actor Andr&eacute; Benjamin (AKA Andr&eacute; 3000), Mexican actor Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, and American actor and director Adrien Brody. Procter &amp; Gamble chose the three because of their stylish, individually sculpted facial hair as well as their strong sense of self and authentic style, all of which appeal to younger males.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo whether you are targeting moms, young men, dads, or kids, old-school trawl net methods of reaching your audience are a thing of the past. Savvy marketers will hit their targets with laser focus through hyperlocal digital advertising.</p>\r\n	t	2012-11-20 13:49:04	\N	2012-11-20 13:49:04	2013-09-04 16:27:00.440648	50	shopper marketing, brands, Procter & Gamble, hyperlocal targeting, MaxPoint Interactive

Here are five tips for making sure no money is left on the table come Thursday:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep It Local</strong> &ndash; Last-minute shoppers scrambling for a turkey next week will opt for convenience above all else, choosing to shop local for their final Thanksgiving items. Drive the most traffic to your stores by targeting your ads to customers within just a few miles of your locations instead of blanketing an entire DMA.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Connect with Shoppers Interested in Your Business </strong>&ndash; The best way to maximize your ad spend this season is to reach interested shoppers online before they head to the store. In addition to targeting local Thanksgiving diners, reach shoppers who you know are interested in what you have to offer&mdash;<a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/advertising-tips-and-strategies/advertising-insights/gourmet-and-comfort-food-interest" target="_blank">whether that&rsquo;s a modern twist on a traditional Thanksgiving item or a good old-fashioned classic</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Underestimate the Need for Good Creative</strong> &ndash; Online advertising for the winter holidays is in full swing, which means you&rsquo;ll be up against countless brands and retailers vying for the attention of consumers. With just days until Thanksgiving, however, you don&rsquo;t have the luxury of getting lost in the crowd. Use simple, bold creative with a clear call to action and solid, honest copy.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leverage Your TV Ads </strong>&ndash; You don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel for your Thanksgiving digital advertising push. Take your existing TV advertising spots, for example, and repurpose them as pre-roll video spots online.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Think Multichannel </strong>&ndash; Thanksgiving shoppers will be consuming content in a variety of ways leading up to the holiday&mdash;from browsing for recipes and checking out football schedules on their laptops to monitoring flight delays and tracking the latest weather developments from their smartphones. Maximize your ROI by implementing a multichannel advertising campaign that takes advantage of display, video, and mobile.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOne of the great benefits of digital advertising is that online ads can be up and running within as few as 24 hours. With this and the tips above in mind, every advertiser can make the most of the days leading up to Thanksgiving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Like this post?

But a large budget doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate into big sales results. One small company is turning to online channels to drive in-store sales, but most important, it&rsquo;s hitting its target market on the head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brain-Twist Inc. launched a Slap brand frozen energy drink in April. The first priority? Making sure the target audience was aware of the product. Aimed primarily at college students, Slap relied heavily on social marketing and convenience store placement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;College kids aren&rsquo;t listening to the radio. These kids live online, and if you want to reach them, you have to live online as well,&rdquo; says Mike Oringer, president of Brain-Twist. &ldquo;If you look at a convenience store, that&rsquo;s our target. The average college student is not shopping at the grocery store. Their daily shopping is at the c-store.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeading up to the launch, Brain-Twist partnered with midwestern c-store chain Casey&rsquo;s General Stores for a &ldquo;Frozen Ticket&rdquo; promotion that encouraged Casey&rsquo;s shoppers to register on Slap&rsquo;s Facebook page to receive a BOGO coupon via regular mail. In-store signage supported the promotion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike any good college product, the frozen drink, like a Slurpee, is charged with caffeine, B vitamins and the amino acid taurine. In marketing materials, Brain-Twist is using a &ldquo;Freeze it. Squeeze it. Get Slap&rsquo;d&rdquo; tagline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to extensive Facebook and Twitter promotions to drive students to c-stores, Brain-Twist developed a &ldquo;Freeze Yourself&rdquo; app at Slapfrozen.com, where users can insert their image into virtual blocks of ice in easily sharable photographs. Viral marketing at its best!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe big coup of Brain-Twist was a negotiated placement of Slap energy drinks in Walmart stores in addition to sampling events in areas frequented by students, including campuses, beaches, and amusement parks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe company is also offering an on-pack promotional sweepstakes through which customers can submit a picture of themselves with a Slap beverage for a chance to win a trip to the Snow Village Ice Hotel in Montreal. &ldquo;College kids love dealing with things on a bucket list,&rdquo; Oringer says. &ldquo;An ice hotel is something very cool. This is a clever way of appealing to them and reinforces our brand attributes.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe moral of this story is to know what your audience likes, know how they act, and know how to reach them. The rest will fall in place.</p>\r\n	t	2012-11-07 20:54:31	\N	2012-11-07 20:54:31	2013-09-04 16:31:04.026042	50	brand promotions, brands, shopper marketing

The status quo simply won&rsquo;t cut it anymore as smart consumers look to get the most value out of a product, whether it&rsquo;s from price or promotion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPepsiCo subsidiary The Quaker Oats Co. launched a multiyear partnership with the Chicago Fire, a Major League Soccer (MLS) club. The summer/fall promotions target loyalty card customers at Jewel-Osco, the Chicago-based Supervalu chain. Shoppers can purchase three Quaker products at various participating supermarkets and receive a free ticket to one of the Fire&rsquo;s regular-season matches. In addition, shoppers who purchase any Quaker product with their loyalty card automatically receive an entry into a sweepstakes to win a trip to Harrison, New Jersey, to watch the Fire play in person. Additional prizes include tickets to home games, jerseys, T-shirts, scarves, and Jewel gift cards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShelley Pisarra, senior director of shopper insights and marketing at Quaker Foods &amp; Snacks says this of the promotion: &ldquo;[We] want consumers, especially mothers with kids in the household, to be aware that Quaker has healthy products to start the day. Additionally, we want to reach both current soccer fans and engage new fans who may have never attended a game.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe program is a four-way win among consumers, Quaker, Jewel, and MLS, where customers get rewarded for their loyalty, Jewel enjoys more traffic in its stores, Quaker sells more healthy products, and MLS increases its fan base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Jewel offer, the onus was on the giveaway. &ldquo;We wanted shoppers and the Fire fans to know this was a one-of-a-kind prize that only Quaker could provide,&rdquo; Pisarra said. Everyone loves an exclusive, until a copycat comes along.

Smart marketers know that will never happen and use kids as vehicles to attract moms&rsquo; attention to certain products. <!--more-->Cereal has done it for years with the promise of &ldquo;a prize in every box.&rdquo; Regardless of whether their kids actually like the cereal or not, most of the time, moms purchase the product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing beyond the edible consumables, Kimberly-Clark is grabbing kids&rsquo; attention in the aisles with Tinker Bell and Spider-Man on nighttime underwear brand GoodNites. According to Dave Caputo, senior brand manager for GoodNites, his team is &ldquo;targeting moms of kids age 4&ndash;6 who are still using training pants to help manage bedwetting.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Spidey&rdquo; for boys and &ldquo;Tink&rdquo; for girls are targeting more than moms; they&rsquo;re catching the eyes of moms&rsquo; younger shopping companions. Why Spider-Man and Tinker Bell? According to Caputo, his team selected them based on research of character appeal by the entertainment firms of Walt Disney Co. (Tinker Bell) and Marvel Entertainment (Spider-Man). &ldquo;We relied on our partners at Marvel and Disney to help us come up with the right characters for the age range, and we think we hit a home run.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI can almost bet with certainty that they will hit that home run. Smart partnerships with kid-centric brands can accelerate awareness and ultimately, sales. Appealing to shoppers at two very different ages for a single product is extremely difficult, but as Kimberly-Clark has shown, not impossible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe advertising and promotion is wide-ranging, including traditional print advertising in mom and parent magazines, free-standing inserts, and public relations. More important, there is a huge digital component, including parenting websites, retailer microsites, social media, and mommy bloggers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith measured success, I have a feeling that more CPG advertisers will be looking toward popular characters for future campaigns&mdash;likely coinciding with the next children&rsquo;s blockbuster hit.

But in the end, the stakes are high, which means the process is well worth your time and attention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere are a few tips to consider as you start your creative agency search:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Look for an agency with a portfolio of diverse clients, including some in your industry.</strong><br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t underestimate the value of working with an agency that understands the broader market landscape and industry terminology.<strong> </strong>Companies that shy away from agencies that have worked with a competitor fail to see the value in the situation. An agency that has worked with a competitor probably understands the nuances and challenges of the market. It has likely done a fair amount of focus-group testing to understand the messages and themes that resonate with customers and prospects and can share those lessons learned. There is also far less ramp-up time for an agency like this, which means you can stay focused on the creative aspect of design and execution and worry less about the agency &ldquo;getting it.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Make sure the agency has experience designing for digital channels.</strong><br />\r\nThere are still a number of agencies out there that focus solely on print or traditional channels, or that &ldquo;dabble&rdquo; in&mdash;or even outsource&mdash;digital work. Although that may fit your need for the short term, it&rsquo;s best to work with an agency that has experience working across various digital platforms. As the world moves further away from print and more toward digital, you will want your ideas to translate in every medium. If the agency does not have the experience, but you really want to work with it, ensure that the agency has a strong partner network of digital experts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Remember that chemistry is important.</strong><br />\r\nFrom start to finish, a creative process can take months and even years to complete. In short, you&rsquo;re going to be with these guys for a while. It is important that you like your team. Sure, there will be creative differences and some bumps in the road, but you have to have a mutual respect and understanding that you are all working toward the greater end. One component of chemistry to consider is location. Many of the world&rsquo;s most creative minds reside in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. If your company doesn&rsquo;t mind paying for travel or is comfortable with videoconferencing, it may not matter where your agency of record is headquartered. If your past experiences with vendors have shown you that local contacts equal better relationships with your team, narrow your search to those agencies that are close.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Find an agency that can clearly define the project process for you.</strong><br />\r\nYou should feel comfortable knowing how your project will progress.<strong> </strong>If you have ever been through the process, you know that everyone will have something to say about your creative campaign when all is said and done. Some good, some bad, some complaints, some praise. That is why it is critical that any agency you work with clearly define the project process before you start. If you are far along a path of design and your stakeholder changes his mind, what happens? How far does that set you back? You want to make sure you set a series of check-ins and tests along the way and that everyone (on both sides) remains committed to the process. Setting an anticipated timeline of deliverables up front saves a lot of heartache in the long run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Have your own tips for selecting a creative agency?

However, the company found that its business model was just not sustainable for the future. Does this mean doom and gloom for other hyperlocal business models?</p>\r\n	<p>Recently, we learned that NBC News <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/07/tech/innovation/everyblock-closed/?hpt=hp_t3" target="_blank">shut down EveryBlock, its hyperlocal news site</a>. The intent of the site was to provide a collective view of local news, reviews, photos, videos, etc., for people at the town or city level. However, the company found that its business model was just not sustainable for the future. Does this mean doom and gloom for other hyperlocal business models?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo&mdash;and here&rsquo;s why.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Hyperlocal</em> has been an overused, poorly defined term for years, especially in the context of advertising. Some view direct mail as hyperlocal. Others see placing an ad on a local newspaper&rsquo;s site as hyperlocal. Yet, both of these models (much like EveryBlock) have failed to capture the essence and long-term value of customer acquisition and retention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause they take a one-size-fits-all approach. For the most part, they consider everyone within a certain radius to be interested in the same thing. Does the 20-year-old student care about the same products, services, and content as her 80-year-old grandfather who lives in the same town? It&rsquo;s highly unlikely. There is no precision or science to this approach. It is not customized to a very specific audience. It is also a waste of valuable resources and dollars, which many small local businesses don&rsquo;t have to spend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHyperlocal should be about understanding and catering to an individual&rsquo;s (or close group of individuals&rsquo;) interests, preferences, and propensities. Herein lies the advantage of hyperlocal when it comes to advertising. Imagine a world in which the new martini bar in town can tailor and execute a digital advertising campaign to its key demographic: women ages 25&ndash;50, making $100,000 or more a year and living within a five-mile radius of the bar. Had that bar advertised in a local paper or even on a local news site, it&rsquo;s very unlikely it would have hit even a fraction of its intended audience. With a truly hyperlocal ad campaign, a restaurant (or retailer or brand) has the power to reach only the audience it believes is most likely to come into its establishment and drive sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, although the intentions have been good, we believe that the term hyperlocal has been given a bad name in the industry. An advertiser needs much more than a zip code or DMA (designated market area) to truly get hyperlocal. Seventy-five percent of all US consumer spending occurs at retail locations within 15 miles of consumers&rsquo; homes&mdash;an area smaller than most DMAs.<sup>1</sup> By targeting the most relevant consumers at the neighborhood level instead of the entire DMA, businesses can serve digital ads to only the most qualified prospects, thereby reducing wasteful ad spend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s take a look at regional businesses, such as restaurant chains and franchises. These businesses now have the ability to leverage technology that analyzes and combines offline and online data, enabling them to learn more about their target guests. Using these data, business owners can get hyperlocal by pinpointing the neighborhoods where their ideal customers most likely live. To give a real-world example, a national restaurant chain franchisee who owns more than 100 East Coast locations evaluated what is ordered throughout the day, every day, at each location. By analyzing guest traffic patterns, typical orders, etc., the franchisee was able to identify trends and serve up relevant, online advertising campaigns based on that data and specific to each location.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. Although those who fail to capitalize on what hyperlocal has to offer will continue to fall by the wayside (EveryBlock, for example), there is still tremendous opportunity in the market for those companies that take full advantage of the technology and data available to get it right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<sup>Sources:<br />\r\n1.

The study concluded that a 15% shift in media spend to digital drives a distinct increase in advertiser reach across verticals.</p>\r\n	<p>Recently, the Interactive Advertising Bureau <a href="http://www.iab.net/about_the_iab/recent_press_releases/press_release_archive/press_release/pr-022513_dvresearch" target="_blank">commissioned a study with Nielsen</a> that looked at how the movement of advertising dollars from TV to digital affects the reach and cost of campaigns. The study concluded that a 15% shift in media spend to digital drives a distinct increase in advertiser reach across verticals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNielsen examined 18 real TV schedules across key advertiser verticals. Categories included CPG (specifically health and beauty aids, food, and beverages), technology, automotive, retail, finance, and telecom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe study provided a number of compelling insights that brands should consider as they determine how to divvy up their ad spend. We&rsquo;ve included a few snippets from the findings that we think are most interesting:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Planning and running online ads first can boost how well both the online and TV portions of a campaign work.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOne of the largest risks associated with TV advertising is cost. Nailing a spot during primetime or a big event like the Super Bowl can cost advertisers quite a chunk of change, and there is often little insight into what impact the ad will have. Many national spots are minimally effective because there&rsquo;s no opportunity to target likely purchasers with localized, relevant messaging. For instance, a luxury car brand is more likely to have success if it targets a neighborhood of wealthy consumers with disposable income, rather than targeting a lower-income neighborhood or one that relies heavily on public transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study notes these limitations of TV advertising, finding that message recall from an online ad is 40%, double that of what TV (broadcast and cable) nets (20%). General recall from online ads is 64%, and brand recall is 50%; TV advertising teeters at 46% and 27%, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning and running video ads online prior to running the same ads on TV, however, boosted brand recall by 33%. Similarly, viewers of an online display ad were 25% more likely to remember the brand if they had seen the ad online before viewing the ad on TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined, digital and TV advertising can be a powerful mix, more powerful than either channel is alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Online viewers watch more online video content for longer.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe study found that traditional TV viewing numbers are somewhat flat while total monthly online streaming numbers continue to rise. The average viewer now watches about six hours of streamed content per month. The demographic most affected by the switch from traditional TV to online streaming is 18- to 34-year-olds. Women tend to stream more content than men, while men tend to spend more time viewing the content (with the exception of long-form content).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These insights are a goldmine for brands. Brands not only know where to target their key audience, but also how long is too long before they lose an audience. For instance, if men are more likely to view for longer periods, then brand advertisers can wait a bit longer for the call to action to appear in their videos. On the other hand, ads targeted primarily at women must cut to the chase sooner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reallocating dollars to online channels builds higher quality, more effective reach at a lower cost.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBoth CPG and non-CPG brands can greatly enhance their effectiveness by allocating some of their overall ad spend to digital. The report indicates that by shifting to digital, advertisers see a 4% increase in overall reach. The most effective approach is a blend of TV and online advertising. CPG advertisers can reach 17% of their audience on both platforms by shifting 15% of spend to digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the importance of digital in the advertising ecosystem continues to gain traction. Within our own customer base, we&rsquo;ve found that the national brands that focus on a hybrid of national TV and local online campaigns have had the most success. However, we also continue to see a great deal of traction for small and midsize companies that commit a majority of their budgets to online channels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will be interesting to continue to watch this shift, especially as the 18&ndash;34 demographic continues to mature and rely on digital as its primary channel for information and entertainment.</p>\r\n	t	2013-03-07 19:10:35	\N	2013-03-07 19:10:35	2013-09-04 14:57:51.074973	58	TV advertising, video ads, digital advertising, media spend

But there are three often overlooked ways big data can be used more effectively in digital advertising for campaign precision and scale: audience discovery, cross-correlation, and dynamic decision-making.</p>\r\n	<p>Big data is extremely valuable when it comes to affecting the outcomes of advertising campaigns. But there are three often overlooked ways big data can be used more effectively in digital advertising for campaign precision and scale: audience discovery, cross-correlation, and dynamic decision-making.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Audience Discovery:</strong> Until now, big data has been somewhat static in providing insights on consumers (where they live, what they buy, what their demographics are, etc.). Much of this data is outdated by the time it reaches an advertiser. Consumer preferences change in real time, and so should the information you&rsquo;re using to drive your advertising decisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">By analyzing billions (and sometimes trillions) of data points in real time</a> on everything ranging from social media discussions to point-of-sale (POS) data, advertisers get a clearer picture of exactly who their consumers are, what they are interested in, and when and why they buy. For instance, just because Sally makes $100,000 a year, has two kids, and is 35 years old, that doesn&rsquo;t mean she is going to buy a minivan. It&rsquo;s more important to know where Sally lives, how she buys, what she has purchased recently, what she is interested in on social networks, what her lifestyle preferences are, and where and when she shops. Taking these data points and providing a real-time snapshot of habits and preferences is much more specific and targeted to Sally&mdash;and empowers an advertiser to act in real time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Cross-Correlation: </strong>Cross-correlation is critical to gaining that deeper level of consumer insight. For instance, an advertiser should not just want to understand that Sally buys BrandX jeans, but rather what that purchase says about what she will buy at the grocery store (for example, that she&rsquo;ll buy BrandY olive oil). Or perhaps a neighborhood is indexing high for searches and POS data on heart medication. The natural cross-correlation there may mean that consumers in that neighborhood are also looking to purchase aspirin as a treatment to lower the risk of a heart attack. At first glance, this may not have been a neighborhood the advertiser would have naturally targeted for heart medication, but the cross-correlation of data points makes it a solid case for an advertising campaign&mdash;and one with enormous scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Dynamic Decision-Making: </strong>By leveraging information and making it actionable in real time, advertisers can glean immediate results from campaigns. For example, an allergy drug manufacturer would typically drop an ad campaign in April or May, when spring allergies kick into high gear across the United States. <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/online-advertising-news/most-concerned-cities-about-flu" target="_blank">Now, they can use big data to cross-analyze weather patterns, consumer purchase data, and social media postings, among other data sets, at the moment they are happening.</a> This means they can access the precise time (right down to the day) and city where allergies are affecting consumers and hit &ldquo;go&rdquo; on a digital campaign that targets this specific group of consumers. Depending on the severity of the allergy season, they can scale the campaign up and down as needed. This precision and ability to scale will radically change the way advertising decisions are made in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn all, big data is now in the grasp of everyone and is making advertisers smarter and campaigns far more precise and effective. By combining audience discovery, cross-correlation, and dynamic data, advertisers can make smarter decisions and experience immediate results.</p>\r\n	t	2013-02-15 14:32:55	\N	2013-02-15 14:32:55	2013-09-04 15:02:36.67818	58	big data, audience discovery, digital advertising, cross-correlation

But what happens after the game? Does brand awareness spike? Do sales increase? How can brands carry that momentum forward to actually drive sales?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/iStock_000020890275XSmall.jpg"><img alt="Get more from your Super Bowl ads with a hyperlocal online advertising campaign" src="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/iStock_000020890275XSmall.jpg" style="border:0pt none; float:right; height:226px; padding-bottom:10px; padding-left:10px; width:340px" title="Get more from your Super Bowl ads with a hyperlocal online advertising campaign" /></a>One of the most effective ways to continue to drive value from the big investment of the Super Bowl ad blitz is to execute a <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/1/11/taking-hyperlocal-campaigns-to-a-national-level" target="_blank">hyperlocal advertising campaign</a> to further the momentum started by the humorous or creative commercial. By using all the assets available from the national campaign, brands can quickly and cost-effectively execute a hyperlocal campaign to drive sales in regions across the country. As a result, brands can turn that buzzing into buying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, Volkswagen could create an online advertising campaign that targets only specific neighborhoods in the &ldquo;yuppie&rdquo; sections of major towns near their dealerships, based on the data and interest level of consumers in that area. They could also add a call-to-action that entices those consumers to go to their local dealership to check out the car. This approach helps brands get highly targeted, with little investment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">Technology like ours</a> helps these brands identify the<strong><em> neighborhoods</em></strong> that are most interested in a brand (based on demographics, POS data, and social media chatter, among billions of other data sources.) As we shift away from direct mailers and local newspaper ads, hyperlocal advertising becomes an even more critical ingredient of turning brand awareness into sales in a timely and effective fashion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s also an effective method for understanding cross-selling opportunities. For instance, if we measure an uptick in interest around a new flavor of spicy Doritos throughout certain neighborhoods in the United States, it&rsquo;s likely that data can be used to identify people who like spicy foods. That information can then be used to help a Mexican restaurant chain with new menu items drive sales, or even help a brand of salsa make inroads in new markets. The opportunities are endless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo who wins the Super Bowl trophy when it comes to brands? We believe it&rsquo;s those who think national AND execute local.</p>\r\n	t	2013-02-01 15:33:07	\N	2013-02-01 15:33:07	2013-09-04 15:11:17.271498	60	Super Bowl ads, hyperlocal advertising, online advertising

And it&rsquo;s not only flu shots and brand-name medicines that are boosting profits&mdash;many generic products, including cleaning solutions and disinfectants, are flying off the shelves as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you&rsquo;re in the business of selling flu products, this can be a great time to move your store-brand items. Here are a few tips:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Offer Coupons and Discounts for Generic Products &ndash;</strong> Generic products are often already priced lower than their brand counterparts, but offering additional promotions and discounts can bring people into your store and push them over the edge on switching from the big brands to your store brand.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Look at Store Sales Data to Target the Right Locations &ndash; </strong>MaxPoint has run many campaigns for pharmacies and stores trying to sell generic products. Our experience has shown that you cannot make universal assumptions about which customers will be likely to switch from brand-name items to generics. For example, although generics are less expensive than their brand equivalents, having a lower income does not always indicate that the customer will switch to generics. Instead, you must look at sales data to see which of your locations have a track record of customers switching from brands to generics. Once you select the right stores, you can reliably target the best neighborhoods for your campaign.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Forget Supporting Products &ndash;</strong> The season is not just about flu shots and cold medicine. According to MaxPoint&rsquo;s <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/online-advertising-news/most-concerned-cities-about-flu" target="_blank">monthly Interest Index</a>, many shoppers are interested in supporting products, such as hand sanitizer, chicken soup, vitamin C, and orange juice. You can get a lot of mileage out of the flu by promoting in-store specials on other products and tying them into your advertisements. Even if customers buy brand-name flu medicine, you may still get them to buy store-brand hand sanitizers or thermometers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep Running Campaigns Over the Next Few Months &ndash;</strong> According to an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/health/flu-dont-know/index.html" target="_blank">article on cnn.com</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention claims that we still don&rsquo;t have a great idea of when the flu season officially ends (it may be as late as May). Although sickness peaks in January and February, you are likely to still see flu remedy sales in March and April.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough you may hate getting sick, the flu can be one of the biggest drivers in pharmacies and grocery stores this time of year. With more than 47 states declaring flu advisories, this year may be one of the roughest flu seasons in some time. And with top news sites covering the event, you&rsquo;ll get a major boost to your online advertising simply through the exposure.

So what is native advertising, and how does it stack up to other online channels?<br />\r\n<!--more--><br />\r\n<em>Native advertising</em> refers to ads displayed in context of the publication. Native ads take on the look and feel of the publishing site and fit within the flow of the user experience. For example, Facebook&rsquo;s sponsored stories use Facebook&rsquo;s blue as well as the typical font and style of a status update. Other examples of native advertisements are promoted tweets on Twitter, sponsored YouTube videos, and even Google paid ads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, online display ads retain the advertiser&rsquo;s branding rather than the publisher&rsquo;s. This makes them stand out and drive the user&rsquo;s attention toward the ad rather than their main task. Additionally, display ads are distributed across many publisher sites rather than just those individual platforms that support native publishing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Tradeoffs of Native Advertising</strong><br />\r\nNative ads definitely show promise. They can drive engagement for ads placed in online publications and social media platforms, particularly when shared within social circles on the big social media platforms. But native ads are far from an online advertising silver bullet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to provide a seamless user experience, native ad publishers require customized content. It can get expensive to consistently produce custom content for each separate publication. For example, the format of a Facebook sponsored story will be quite different from the shorter sponsored Tweet format. And each of these will have a different design and format than a Tumblr or BuzzFeed post. This type of customization requires time and resources that can make the effort cost-prohibitive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-1.50.59-PM.png"><img alt="Example of a Facebook sponsored post" src="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-16-at-1.50.59-PM.png" style="border:0pt none; float:right; height:374px; padding-bottom:10px; padding-left:10px; width:413px" title="Example Facebook sponsored post" /></a></strong>In contrast, display ads come in fairly standardized sizes and formats, so they are a lot easier to create and distribute. Also, ad distribution technology has become very sophisticated in its ability to target the correct audience. By properly layering data from multiple online and offline sources, hyperlocal ad delivery is both cost-efficient and extremely accurate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, according to a survey from Solve Media<sup>1</sup>, only 14.3% of publishers are very likely to add a native advertising option. As a result, native advertising can cast a smaller net than other forms of online advertising. If you use a hyperlocal strategy for display and video, you&rsquo;ll reach a larger audience of qualified customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNative ads can sometimes be <em>more</em> disruptive to users than traditional online advertisements. People are used to seeing display advertisements on the web, and they understand their purpose. But native is a relatively new format, and users are still adapting to it. If they&rsquo;re not done well, the ads can leave customers with a bad impression.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, the other day I was looking for funny posters on a blog. I had just seen a picture of a dog dressed as a banana when I noticed a video post. I clicked the video and watched for a few moments. I watched about a full minute before I noticed the &ldquo;Sponsored&rdquo; label in the upper left and realized that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be a humor video, but rather an ad for continuing education. This annoyed me because I expected it to be funny. If the advertisement had been ironic and had included a funny video of a cat, it would have made more sense in context (and I probably would have shared it with my friends). But instead, it just left me shaking my head.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOdds are good that as native advertisements become more prevalent, people will get used to them as they have display and video pre-roll. But between now and then, you run the risk of leaving a bad brand impression if your ad doesn&rsquo;t add to the experience of the publishing site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt takes a lot of time, effort, and money to do native advertising effectively. Native ads can&rsquo;t beat the scalability of online display and video advertising. While they offer a lot of promise, don&rsquo;t go dropping your other online and offline efforts just yet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<sup>Sources:<br />\r\n1. <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/12/12/study-says-half-of-media-buyers-will-try-native-advertising-in-2013/" target="_blank">http://paidcontent.org/2012/12/12/study-says-half-of-media-buyers-will-try-native-advertising-in-2013/</a></sup></p>\r\n	t	2013-01-16 19:09:45	\N	2013-01-16 19:09:45	2013-09-04 15:16:48.537058	58	native advertising, sponsored stories, promoted tweets, MaxPoint

If mobile users can&rsquo;t find you easily, they may move on to a more user-friendly competitor. Nothing screams, &ldquo;I am stuck in the first decade of the Millennium&rdquo; like failing to have a mobile-friendly website. An app that is compatible with smartphones and tablets and that is relevant to your business can&rsquo;t hurt either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a July 2012 survey of US adult smartphone Internet users conducted by market research and consulting firm <a href="http://www.smithgeiger.com/" target="_blank">SmithGeiger</a> and <a href="http://www.sterlingresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank">Sterling Research</a> on behalf of Google, about two-thirds of respondents said they were more likely to purchase something from a mobile-optimized site, while three-quarters said they were more likely to make a return visit to the site. That&rsquo;s pretty compelling data.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsumers&rsquo; desire for mobile-friendly sites stretched across pretty much all verticals, but its use was often closely tied to obtaining information about physical business locations. The first or second most important task identified by consumers in all industry categories was getting directions to a store or obtaining store hours. Of smartphone users, 74% named obtaining the location or operating hours of a physical store as their most important mobile retail task. That was followed by contacting the store (64%) and getting information about products (61%).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf that hasn&rsquo;t convinced you of the urgency in updating your website, Google found that failing to design sites for mobile had spillover effects, potentially damaging the reputation of the company. And consumers&rsquo; adoption of the mobile web is only going to continue. eMarketer projects that the number of US mobile Internet users will hit 198.8 million in 2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, while you are upgrading your site, consider supercharging your mobile advertising as well. Sometimes advertisers try to be too clever with their creative, and they miss the basics. Since consumers in shopping mode are primarily using their mobile phones for getting directions and contacting the store, your mobile ad creative better include &ldquo;click to call&rdquo; with your store&rsquo;s phone number and &ldquo;click to map&rdquo; to help consumers find the location they are looking for. Don&rsquo;t miss the basics&mdash;start using mobile effectively to drive in-store traffic and sales.</p>\r\n	t	2013-01-04 17:16:52	\N	2013-01-04 17:16:52	2013-09-10 14:52:04.059402	59	mobile advertising, mobile devices, retailers, smartphones, mobile-friendly websites

The story, based on research from Kantar, suggests that these chains are becoming more aggressive and targeted in their reach to consumers by focusing primarily on personalization with an emphasis on &ldquo;delivering the right promotion to the right shopper at the right time and in the right place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n	<p>The Shopper Technology Institute <a href="http://www.shoppertech.org/lm032113.html" target="_blank">recently wrote a piece</a> discussing how some large chains, such as CVS, Kroger, and Safeway, benefit from sophisticated brand-funded shopper marketing campaigns. The story, based on research from Kantar, suggests that these chains are becoming more aggressive and targeted in their reach to consumers by focusing primarily on personalization with an emphasis on &ldquo;delivering the right promotion to the right shopper at the right time and in the right place.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most robust loyalty card programs can track what consumers are buying, when they are buying it, and at which locations. As a result, retailers can target consumers with timely promotions, messages, and rewards while learning more about those shoppers&rsquo; interests to aid future personalized marketing efforts. These same insights are also very valuable to brands looking to sell their products in these stores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the story, &ldquo;personalized marketing has proven its ability [to] drive increased basket size, increased shopping trips, and increased shopper retention over time. <strong>And if you&rsquo;re a top-tier retailer, you get all these benefits paid for by manufacturers funding those personalized promotions to your shoppers.</strong>&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what&rsquo;s a midsized or independent retailer to do? These retailers have neither the budget of the big guys, nor the same kind of sophisticated technology. Yet, they still need to push product and drive sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, the Kantar report suggests that there will continue to be a &ldquo;more extensive collaboration between the retailer and brand, with a focus on clear objectives and performance accountability,&rdquo; a trend that clearly favors larger retail partners, especially those on which the brands have focused entire teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, sophisticated loyalty programs are effective if you can afford them and have the resources. But equally as effective is investing shopper marketing dollars in <a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/MI_SHOPPER_WEB_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">hyperlocal digital advertising campaigns</a>. With limited budgets and a need to focus on consumers within a very tight radius, independent and midsized stores know that focus is key. What&rsquo;s more, they understand their target customers, where they live, and what they are interested in. Hyperlocal digital advertising allows them to target their ideal shoppers to drive traffic and in-store sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, if an independent grocer is selling a new brand of gourmet coffee, it knows that not everyone who happens to live near the store is going to be interested. In addition to traditional advertising efforts, such as the weekly circular and local paper, the grocer can get more precise by creating a hyperlocal digital advertising campaign that focuses on shoppers ages 25&ndash;50 with an interest in more expensive coffee (maybe those without a hip cafe in the neighborhood).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd to make the campaign immediately actionable, the grocer can leverage real-time interest data, such as which consumers are planning to shop within the next few hours (based on past habits and social media posts), which are looking for a local coffee shop, or which have disposable income. The campaign can go beyond simply raising awareness for the new brand by offering a coupon to incentivize consumers to come into the store and buy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat may sound just as difficult and expensive to pull off as the big guys&rsquo; sophisticated loyalty programs, but with a partner such as MaxPoint pulling all that data together and executing the program, both the brand and retailer can realize a big return for a relatively small investment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other advantage is that a digital campaign doesn&rsquo;t have to involve long-term planning. In cases when a retailer is carrying an abundance of a brand&rsquo;s product that needs to move before it expires or becomes irrelevant (think turkeys at Thanksgiving or champagne at New Year&rsquo;s), the retailer can activate a campaign within hours to help drive sales at the specific locations where it has excess inventory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe truth is that independent and midsized retailers have a lot to offer the communities they serve. They can compete fiercely against the larger, national chains not by using the same tactics as the largest brands and retailers, but rather by teaming up with partners that focus on targeted, locally focused campaigns.</p>\r\n	t	2013-04-26 14:12:32	\N	2013-04-26 14:12:32	2013-09-04 13:47:23.183149	49	Shopper Technology Institute, personalized marketing, hyperlocal advertising, shopper marketing
862	1	15	mobile-geofencing-an-advertising-trap	Mobile Geofencing—An Advertising Trap?	<p>By now, many in the advertising industry are familiar with the term mobile geofencing, or a retailer&rsquo;s ability to target shoppers passing near its store by establishing a very narrow advertising radius (often just a few feet). Each time a consumer who has downloaded a store&rsquo;s app on their GPS-enabled mobile device enters this tight perimeter, they receive a mobile alert with a special offer from that business.</p>\r\n	<p>By now, many in the advertising industry are familiar with the term mobile geofencing, or a retailer&rsquo;s ability to target shoppers passing near its store by establishing a very narrow advertising radius (often just a few feet). Each time a consumer who has downloaded a store&rsquo;s app on their GPS-enabled mobile device enters this tight perimeter, they receive a mobile alert with a special offer from that business.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSounds brilliant, right? In theory, mobile geofencing is a smart way to reach a handful of shoppers when they are in the immediate area. But if you want to reach a large enough crowd of shoppers that really makes an impact on your business, then geofencing falls short. Some of its flaws include:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Lack of meaningful targeting. </strong>An effective advertising campaign draws the consumer in with messaging that speaks to their interests. Perhaps the shopper is a first-time mom in the market for her first SUV/minivan. Or maybe she&rsquo;s a local college student looking for a cool place to hang with her friends when she is home on break. An effective advertising campaign targets its message and call to action to a specific, well-defined audience&mdash;not just shoppers who happen to walk by a place of business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA geofencing advertising campaign, however, may not allow an advertiser to communicate in a way that&rsquo;s meaningful to a specific consumer. Rather, geofencing generally takes the &ldquo;you are in the area, you must care&rdquo; approach, which is ineffective for most campaigns. To be fair, some geofencing solutions are starting to address this by targeting both location and demographics, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that effective and meaningful targeting takes into consideration where consumers come from, not just where they are at the moment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Tracking can make consumers uncomfortable.</strong> Even though geofencing requires that consumers opt in, many users may not understand the full ramifications. By opting in, consumers allow advertisers to track their every move. Although advertising becomes more effective when it takes into consideration more consumer information, there are some things that people do not want to share&mdash;like how often they visit the doctor&rsquo;s office, where their child goes to preschool each day, or how many times they visit their favorite bar each week. Do you want someone to know every time you leave the house?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Scale is missing.</strong> Geofencing focuses on a very tight radius, making it hard to scale a campaign. You can reach only a handful of consumers traveling within a limited area. By casting such a small net, geofencing limits the ability of mobile ads to generate long-term, sustainable growth and customer return.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSo is there a better way? Yes. A hyperlocal digital or mobile campaign works much better. Geofencing targets customers when they&rsquo;re in the vicinity of the store, but how do you drive them there in the first place? A hyperlocal digital campaign helps you target crowds, rather than a handful, of ideal customers. Hyperlocal advertising goes beyond geofencing, ultimately allowing you to reach local neighborhoods full of shoppers likely to buy your products and services. In the long run, this strategy of reaching the right people at the right time with the right offer combines the precise targeting you need with the scale missing from geofencing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMobile advertising must go beyond targeting shoppers simply because they&rsquo;re within a few feet of a business. There are many tools and technologies available today that empower advertisers to be very precise and focused while also reaching many qualified shoppers.</p>\r\n	t	2013-05-03 19:49:41	\N	2013-05-03 19:49:41	2013-10-15 13:24:07.964645	59	mobile, geofencing, advertising

It&rsquo;s a constant topic of debate within the business, technology, and even mainstream press, and it is starting to gain some traction in verticals like marketing, banking, retail, and human resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor marketers, big data enables a more holistic view of customers, creating a unified view of all online and offline behaviors: Where do customers shop? What brands do they buy? What level of influence do they have on their friends&rsquo; purchasing decisions because they share on social media? Many companies now even have a unique and personalized docket of preferences for each customer&mdash;a gold mine for understanding what customers really want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324178904578340071261396666.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_LEADTop" target="_blank">recent <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article</a> provided a great example of how Intercontinental Hotels created a highly customized communication targeted at its Priority Club Rewards members. When referring to Intercontinental&rsquo;s new email marketing programs, the piece said, &ldquo;Where previous campaigns might have on average seven to 15 customized marketing messages, the new campaign has 1,552. The messages are rolled out in stages to an initial core of 12 customer groups, each of which is defined by 4,000 attributes.&rdquo; In the end, the new campaign generated a 35% higher conversion rate than previous campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt may seem obvious that getting smarter about what your customers want is a more effective way to reach them, but thousands of marketing campaigns are executed every day that lack the precision that big data offers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow just imagine how much more precise big data can make a marketing campaign when you&rsquo;re trying to go hyperlocal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo longer do retailers and brands have to spend the time and money to roll out national campaigns to every neighborhood in the country. Instead, big data helps them understand where likely buyers actually live&mdash;all the way down to the neighborhood level&mdash;so they can effectively target that group based on preferences, purchase history, and social media tendencies. This is a radically different approach from the way national advertising campaigns used to run. Now, advertisers can run the big ad on a major network for brand exposure but then scale the campaign down to specifically target the neighborhoods in the central part of Michigan or the western part of New York, for example, where shoppers are most likely to respond to the call to action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs big data strategies and practices continue to evolve, marketing campaigns will only get smarter and more effective. So if you don&rsquo;t think big data is a big deal yet, just wait until your favorite hotel tells you that they know you are ready to take a vacation, just as you&rsquo;re thinking it yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Is your company using big data in its advertising?

These retailers have found that contextual ads are quite effective when they encourage a consumer to take action based on the weather. For instance, ACE Hardware has started to use real-time mobile ads to target consumers with deals on shovels and de-icers in advance of big snowstorms. They plan to do the same this spring by targeting consumers with fertilizer brands and other garden products when the weather is prime for planting and maintaining one&rsquo;s yard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis strategy seems obvious, yet smart. The examples shared in <em>Adweek</em> just scratch the surface when it comes to where the market is going and what brands and retailers are already doing to drive real-time interest and sales. At MaxPoint, we&rsquo;ve built our business around empowering brands and retailers to target consumers with the right product at the right time, regardless of which digital medium consumers prefer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Let&rsquo;s say you run a large grocery store chain. Your store in downtown Akron, Ohio, has a surplus of holiday Pop-Tarts, and there are just seven days until Christmas. Why not target consumers within an eight-mile radius who are likely to buy Pop-Tarts (young kids, college students) with a special offer to drive traffic and demand at your store?</li>\r\n\t<li>Or perhaps your vodka brand is introducing a new flavor and would like to target consumers within a 10-mile radius of a liquor store who score highly for an interest in holiday cocktails.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMaxPoint can identify hot spots of real-time interest and align that data with key demographics and physical locations to roll out a campaign that captures your audience when they are in the buying mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith information flowing so fast and furious, and billions of data points on consumer behavior and preferences being created every day, there is no question that real-time advertising is the real deal.

There are just a few more weeks until the big day is here. The Christmas music has been playing since November, or in some places even before the last Halloween candy hit the bottom of the bag, and people are in the mood to look for the perfect gift. With few shopping days, and even fewer shipping days, until Christmas, a targeted online advertising campaign can bring those last-minute shoppers right through your doors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you haven&rsquo;t started or still need to ramp up your holiday advertising, then going online with your ads is the smartest move you can make. Here&rsquo;s why:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Start Running a Campaign in a Single Day. You don&rsquo;t have to wait days or weeks to get your campaign up and running like you do with print ads. It can often take as little as 24 hours to start getting your message in front of targeted customers. And with fewer shopping days until Christmas, every moment counts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Make Inventory Changes Quickly. If you have a particularly hot item or special deal that you want to highlight, then you can make changes to your existing advertising materials mid-campaign. Unlike a print ad, you can easily update your online campaign without a ton of time or money.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reach People Where They Are. Consumers are increasingly going online for their entertainment. According to Forrester Research data cited in the Barclays Capital Internet Data Book, online has become the primary medium for people between 18 and 54. And with the added targeting power that an online campaign offers, you know you&rsquo;re reaching the right people.</li>\r\n\t<li>Save Money by Reusing Previously Successful Holiday Advertising Materials. If you ran a campaign last year that was particularly effective, then there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t have the same kind of windfall this year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Complement Your Other Advertising Methods. Of course, online ads don&rsquo;t completely replace traditional advertising methods. But by running an online campaign in combination with more traditional advertising methods, you can increase your exposure and make both methods more effective.</li>\r\n\t<li>Take Advantage of Mobile. Mobile is growing rapidly and offers a few added benefits over other forms of advertising. With mobile ads, you can reach your customers wherever they are: in-between meetings at work, traveling on the bus or train, or even relaxing at home in the evening. And you can often use your other online display ads for mobile.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe window for holiday shopping is closing.

Translation: a combination of <em>global</em> and <em>local</em> meaning &ldquo;locally adapting a universally embraced core idea that will resonate in any market anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n	<p><em>Harvard Business Review</em> recently <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/great_advertising_is_both_loca.html" target="_blank">ran a piece</a> that looked at how global brands (or those striving to be so) must look at advertising through a new lens: the so-called<em> glocal </em>lens. Translation: a combination of <em>global</em> and <em>local</em> meaning &ldquo;locally adapting a universally embraced core idea that will resonate in any market anywhere in the world.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Glocal Strategy</strong><br />\r\nThe authors of the piece&mdash;Jerry Wind (professor of marketing at the Wharton School), Stan Sthanunathan (vice president of marketing strategy and insights at the Coca-Cola Company), and Rob Malcolm (former president of global marketing at Diageo)&mdash;shared some interesting insights about brands&rsquo; successful and failed endeavors to appeal to a global audience. They said that a successful glocal strategy rests on three pillars:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A global concept that addresses a universal human motivation</li>\r\n\t<li>A unified brand vision with creative delivery that respects local nuances and empowered consumers in each locale</li>\r\n\t<li>An organizational architecture, including culture, technological platform, and dedicated resources, that emphasizes and facilitates dynamic and effective collaboration between the developers of global strategy and local strategists and implementers</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe authors note the importance of starting with a theme that appeals to a global audience but that also includes elements that would appeal to the local audiences that will see and hear the campaign. It is important to appeal to the subset of consumers and potential customers within each market. They say that the framework respects and encourages local decision-making while at the same time supporting a unified brand identity. Moreover, the organizational architecture aims to tap into the best ideas and talent, no matter where in the world they come from; this fluid process lets more innovative ideas get recognized and become the basis for a global strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If done strategically and with the right mix of creative and branding elements, this approach is highly successful. Brands like Coca-Cola and Johnnie Walker are just a few that have executed a glocal strategy successfully.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Nlocal Strategy</strong><br />\r\nWhat&rsquo;s more, the authors say that glocal is not strictly for global brands. With so many omniculturals (people who define themselves by their lifestyles and economic and educational attainment more so than by their race or ethnicity) living in the United States, this same approach can work at the national level. This is something we at MaxPoint have been talking about for some time. We have a unique way to identify omniculturals using our Digital Zip&reg; technology, which analyzes billions of data points for neighborhoods across the United States. Once we&rsquo;ve considered offline point-of-sale data as well as shoppers&rsquo; consumption of social media, videos, music, local Web pages, and online magazines (to name just a few), we can run digital ads for our clients targeted to the right omniculturals at the neighborhood level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur nlocal (national and local) approach not only allows national brands to target the right neighborhoods with the right message at the right time but also eliminates wasteful spending often associated with local marketing and advertising campaigns. We work with a lot of brands to help them repurpose their assets from a national campaign and apply them to a local market in a meaningful way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe strongly believe that more retailers and brands have to start thinking glocal and nlocal as they build their branding and advertising campaigns. The technology is in place to make these approaches seamless, successful, and scalable.</p>\r\n	t	2013-04-11 20:05:56	\N	2013-04-11 20:05:56	2013-09-04 13:52:05.20643	58	glocal, nlocal, local advertising, omniculturals

Recently, <em>Advertising Age</em> dedicated a section of its print issue to the topic and shared a number of interesting insights.</p>\r\n	<p>We&rsquo;ve <a href="http://staging.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/3/21/is-big-data-a-big-deal" target="_blank">talked a lot about big data on this blog</a> and the impact it has on smarter and more effective digital advertising. Recently, <em>Advertising Age</em> dedicated <a href="http://adage.com/archive-date?pub=11&amp;vol=84" target="_blank">a section of its print issue</a> to the topic and shared a number of interesting insights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe series of stories looked at the big data revolution from all angles. Is big data too Big Brother? Is the amount of data growing too quickly for advertisers to keep up with? Is big data really effective in advertising, or is it just a bunch of relatively random guesses based on previous online purchasing and browsing behaviors? Or, have some companies mastered a big data strategy, and do they hold the keys to the kingdom?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe answer is yes and no to all the above. We&rsquo;ve extracted some interesting pieces from the stories in <em>Ad Age</em> to paint a picture of where the big data industry appears to be today&mdash;at least as it concerns the advertising world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Data Hoarding</strong><br />\r\nIn her story &ldquo;<a href="http://adage.com/article/data-at-work/data-war-dispatch-turning-data-crude-real-revenue/240358/" target="_blank">Data War Dispatch: Turning Data Crude Into Real Revenue</a>,&rdquo; Kate Kaye wrote that &ldquo;data commoditization is a concern for the new crop of information merchants. . . . Brands are especially averse to the risk of competitors accessing their information. It&#39;s no wonder large retailers and product brands keep the bulk of their customer data locked in secure servers housed in the Fort Knox-esque facilities of data firms such as Acxiom, like so much gold bullion.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough some retailers do opt for a more holistic view of data via data firm APIs, many are still wary of granting too much access. As a result, these retailers run the risk of missing out on more effective and precise ways of reaching customers and prospects. The one-dimensional (although very rich) data they have tells just a part of the story of consumer behavior and preferences. Because this hoarding mentality is hurting many large retailers, it&rsquo;s critical that they look beyond their fears to incorporate a broader digital data strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Data Lifecycle</strong><br />\r\nOne of the most interesting elements of the big data issue was an <a href="http://adage.com/article/dataworks/purchase-targeted-ads-data-s/240300/" target="_blank">infographic</a> that showed the lifecycle of data associated with a single purchase. It was a compelling illustration of how one purchase sets off a chain reaction of data discovery and consumer intelligence inventory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Standalone Data Management Platforms</strong><br />\r\nIt was Jack Neff&rsquo;s piece, however, that resonated with us the most. He discussed the trends that we are seeing within our own customer base of large brands. In his piece, &ldquo;<a href="http://adage.com/article/data-at-work/package-goods-marketers-build-private-trading-desks/240374/" target="_blank">Package-Goods Marketers Build Private Trading Desks to Hoard Data</a>,&rdquo; Neff describes how some large brands, such as Kellogg, Unilever, and Kimberly-Clark, are moving toward a model of creating their own standalone data management platforms and trading desks. This is an effort to reduce expenses associated with large multiclient trading desks and to avoid tying up data and insights in an agency-owned system that the brand may not be able to access in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYet, Forrester Research believes this approach is still rare. In a 2012 Forrester survey, the company found that although a quarter of marketers say they use agency trading desks, only 7% report using in-house trading desks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;My sense is that ultimately a lot of marketers aren&#39;t really set up to take execution fully in-house when they have traditionally been so reliant on external support,&quot; said Forrester analyst Joanna O&#39;Connell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Endgame</strong><br />\r\nThe net/net here is that there is still a lot of shifting going on in the advertising industry when it comes to the most effective and nonintrusive way to use big data. The way brands and retailers attack a big data strategy may differ greatly, but the endgame is to provide a more successful way to reach customers and drive additional revenue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to check out <a href="http://adage.com/archive-date?pub=11&amp;vol=84" target="_blank"><em>Ad Age</em>&#39;s big data issue</a>, and you are interested in how big data may work for your organization, it&rsquo;s a worthy read. The issue contains insights from retailers and brands that have found ways to use big data successfully to improve their understanding of customer segments, effective marketing tactics, and the quickest path to success.</p>\r\n	t	2013-03-29 13:43:43	\N	2013-03-29 13:43:43	2013-09-04 14:54:01.814104	58	Advertising Age, big data, data hoarding

In essence, native advertising is an endorsement or ad disguised as content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, not everyone is a fan. In an article he penned for Digiday, Ben Kunz of media agency Mediassociates <a href="http://www.digiday.com/publishers/native-advertising-is-bad-news/" target="_blank">took this aggressive stance</a> on native advertising:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native advertising is a more insidious encroachment into consumer media content than any prior form of advertising. Billions of banner ad impressions may annoy readers, but they don&rsquo;t misdirect users by disguising the source of the message &mdash; and this is exactly what native does. If publishers and marketers aren&rsquo;t careful, they are going to poison the well of digital ad communications by breaking consumer trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And beyond whether or not native ads are deceitful, this form of digital advertising simply doesn&rsquo;t solve for the real cause of banner blindness: hundreds and thousands of irrelevant ads appear before consumers on a daily basis. After a while, consumers stop looking at the ads altogether because they just don&rsquo;t speak to their needs and interests&mdash;no matter if they&rsquo;re buried in content they like or if they take over the whole screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best digital advertising has focus and is effectively targeted. If you know what a consumer needs or is interested in, you can speak her language and grab her attention in much the same way that she responds to the sound of her name, even if it&rsquo;s on the lips of a mother addressing her child of the same name in the grocery store. That&rsquo;s the kind of digital advertising that drives store traffic and increases sales.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut to get there, you need rich consumer data sources and advanced technology. Sneakily concealing an ad doesn&rsquo;t make it more precise. It just makes it harder to identify as an ad and gives consumers one more reason to lose trust in advertisers and publishers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBanner blindness? It&rsquo;s a real problem that native ads simply can&rsquo;t solve.</p>\r\n	t	2013-04-04 15:17:08	\N	2013-04-04 15:17:08	2013-09-04 13:53:08.181215	58	 digital advertising, hyperlocal advertising, native advertising, banner blindness

Well, they can enhance a user&rsquo;s experience with a website or make their lives easier&mdash;for instance, you can thank cookies for the ability to stay logged in to an application, so you don&rsquo;t have to keep entering your username and password every time. They help site publishers and web applications deliver a more personalized experience for their customers. And cookies are so ubiquitous on the web that many people don&rsquo;t even know when they&rsquo;re on their devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But cookies aren&rsquo;t just for users&mdash;cookies are also used for digital advertising targeting (or re-targeting). When used well, they can help advertisers reach some very targeted customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, cookies are powerful and they have their uses. But cookie targeting does have its limitations. Here are just a few to consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cookies Bring Privacy Concerns&mdash;</strong>If there&rsquo;s a privacy concern on a website, chances are good that cookies are involved. While cookie data usually are anonymized, they still bring some privacy concerns. In fact, some industries, especially the pharmaceutical and health care industries, almost completely shy away from the use of cookies.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cookies Don&rsquo;t Work Well on Mobile&mdash;</strong>Many mobile devices won&rsquo;t accept third-party cookies unless a user explicitly enables them in their device settings. This limits the mobile audience dramatically. To truly target a large number of users on mobile devices, you have to go with another option such as geofencing or neighborhood-level targeting. (In fact, this isn&rsquo;t unique to mobile&mdash;it&rsquo;s more of a web browser setting. Safari doesn&rsquo;t accept third-party cookies by default, and other browsers are following Safari&rsquo;s precedent. So, this means that the audience that can be reached via cookies will continue to dwindle).<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cookies Don&rsquo;t Reach Enough People&mdash;</strong>You simply can&rsquo;t get enough volume by trying to reach people via cookies. Many web users turn off cookies on their computers, making it impossible to reach them. Among those who accept cookies, many delete them on a regular basis. In fact, according to a 2012 comScore study, &ldquo;about 30% of computers have their ad-server cookies deleted in a month, with a frequency of 4+ times per month.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Between the number of people who don&rsquo;t accept cookies and the number of people who frequently delete them, advertisers can find it challenging to reach the number of customers that they need to reach to really move cases of products, rather than just a handful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I mean to say that cookies are never helpful? No. They can be great additions to campaigns&mdash;for those users who accept and keep third-party cookies, they help advertisers target them with precisely relevant ads. However, when using cookies, be careful to make sure you give some indication to the users that you are using cookies, and give them the additional ability to opt out or turn them off. This can be covered in your ad delivery vendor&rsquo;s privacy policy or terms of use. If you are unsure whether or not you have adequately disclosed the use of cookies, ask your delivery vendor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is that cookies can help, but you shouldn&rsquo;t base your entire ad campaign around them. Your better bet is to focus on a hyperlocal digital campaign that targets users on a neighborhood level. Hyperlocal targeting that&rsquo;s not reliant on cookies can help advertisers reach multiple times the number of customers&mdash;and it does so without the privacy concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/When_the_Cookie_Crumbles" target="_blank">http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/When_the_Cookie_Crumbles</a></p>\r\n	t	2013-07-08 17:27:58	\N	2013-07-08 17:36:31.452774	2013-11-01 21:32:21.479944	52	\N

Below is a look back at the strides these retailers have made including details on how they continue to drive brand awareness and excellence.</p>\r\n	<p>Not only is 2012 a big year in terms of new technology launches and strides in the digital advertising industry, but it&rsquo;s a&nbsp; big year&nbsp; for four important retailers: Walmart, Target, Kmart, and Kohl&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2012, Walmart, Target, Kmart, and Kohl&rsquo;s all turn 50 (Happy Birthday!). Below is a look back at the strides these retailers have made including details on how they continue to drive brand awareness and excellence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Walmart:</strong> When Walmart was first introduced into the retail landscape, the retailer ran with the tagline, &ldquo;Walmart &ndash; always the low prices on the brands you trust.&nbsp; Always.&rdquo; Since then, Walmart has continued to stick true to this promise as they have unveiled similar campaigns such as the famous &ldquo;Rollback&rdquo; and &ldquo;Save money. Live better.&rdquo; campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes Walmart so popular is that they listened to their customer&rsquo;s needs and understood the importance of a budget-friendly and seamless shopping experience. In 2012, the retailer continues to leverage digital advertising and in-store displays to get this message across to both current customers and new Walmart shoppers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Target:</strong> Similar to the other retailers turning 50, Target too focuses on being budget-friendly with their famous tagline, &ldquo;Expect more. Pay Less.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the price that drives shoppers to Target but the way Target engages with shoppers in-store.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike many retailers, Target recognizes the importance of an engaging in-store experience. For example, Target uses advertising and in-store messaging to give shoppers tips on what to wear &ndash; first introduced in 1990 with the &ldquo;What to Wear&rdquo; campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Kmart:</strong> Kmart has certainly had its ups and downs over the years but will always be known for its partnerships with Jaclyn Smith (to launch its apparel business) and Martha Stewart (a spokesperson for the brand in past years).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho will Kmart partner with next? That remains to be seen, but using celebrities to get in front of shoppers is a great way to drive traffic and awareness around a brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Kohl&rsquo;s:</strong> A coast-to-coast retailer, Kohl&rsquo;s also focuses on budget-friendliness, engaging in-store experiences and partnerships with famous celebrities. However, what has set aside Kohl&rsquo;s from other retailers is its ability to market to the teenage consumer group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTeenagers for the most part are &ldquo;fashionistas,&rdquo; always concerned with staying on top of the latest fashion trends and taking advice from fashion icons. Kohl&rsquo;s has partnered with various teen icons, such as, J. Lo and American Idol, as well as, tailored campaigns with messaging specifically targeted towards the teenage shopper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what can you take away from this? Listen to your customer, focus on an engaging in-store experience, and leverage resources (e.g. celebrity partnerships) to get in front of a specific audience. However, these are only some elements that make a strong marketing campaign. Combine these tactics with digital advertising, specifically, localized digital advertising to make sure your message and offers are seen by the right audience to continue to drive in-store traffic and retailing success.</p>\r\n	t	2012-04-11 14:37:16	\N	2012-04-11 14:37:16	2013-09-27 03:08:13.076409	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Walmart, Target, Kmart, Kohl's, retail, retail campaigns, digital advertising, localized digital advertising

With good reason&mdash;digital advertising boosts traffic to websites and to stores. But digital is also a powerful branding tool.</p>\r\n	<p>Digital advertising is becoming the weapon of choice for advertisers and brands looking to build their sales. With good reason&mdash;digital advertising boosts traffic to websites and to stores. But digital is also a powerful branding tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing dwindling print readership and declining TV viewership, advertisers are increasingly placing their branding budgets in digital channels. This goes beyond digital display ads&mdash;advertisers are seeing excellent results from mobile display and digital video as well. In other words, they&rsquo;re learning the power of digital to promote the right messages to the right markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The odds are good that you already devote some of your media plan to digital. However, you may want to shift a bigger share online. Here are just four key reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reach a large audience.</strong> The key to a successful awareness campaign is to cast a wide net&mdash;and digital delivers. And it&rsquo;s not just younger audiences that spend their time online&mdash;a <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/205122/#axzz2ae5VM67s" target="_blank">recent MediaPost article</a> claims that 60% of baby boomers say, &ldquo;watching online video an important part of their day.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> People in nearly every age bracket continue to adopt digital as a key media source. As a result, the digital audience grows day by day.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Advertise cost-effectively. </strong>In addition to its scale, digital brings cost effectiveness to the table. Compared to traditional advertising, you can spend your budget far more efficiently online. For example, every dollar spent with MaxPoint allows an advertiser to reach triple the number of markets than with traditional DMA targeting.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reduce wasted impressions.</strong> For print advertising, you don&rsquo;t just pay to reach your customers&mdash;you pay to reach people outside of your demographic. For every newspaper reader who fits your audience segment, there are several who don&rsquo;t. Digital targeting decreases wasted impressions by focusing on a cross segment of a website&rsquo;s visitors. If you really want your brand message to sink in with the ideal audience, then digital is the way to go.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Measure brand lift more easily. </strong>To measure a brand advertisement&rsquo;s effectiveness, you often have to run focus groups that are both expensive and time consuming. But with digital, you can get an accurate brand lift result simply by running a survey in place of an ad impression. For example, if you&rsquo;re running a branding campaign that promotes a cereal as &ldquo;heart-healthy,&rdquo; then you can run a single-question survey to customers that asks if they perceive the cereal is helpful for reducing blood pressure. This provides quick results in a fraction of the time of a focus group.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf you really want to get the biggest bang for your digital buck, then you have to go hyperlocal. And if you use MaxPoint, hyperlocal precision comes without the loss of scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say that an advertising company that sells bedding needs to boost sales of its hypoallergenic bedding line in the Portland, OR market. A digital campaign could help position the company as the leading brand of hypoallergenic bedding within the market. To accomplish this, they should target households with interests in allergy relief that are located around stores that carry the bedding. As a result, they can deliver an effective, focused message to a perfectly focused crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to advertising campaigns, you simply can&rsquo;t get a more versatile and effective channel than digital advertising. The tendency online is to focus on sales and responses&mdash;but don&rsquo;t discount the power of digital branding. And if you want to build extremely targeted awareness in a focused market or audience segment, then go the extra step with a hyperlocal digital advertising campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/205122/#axzz2ae5VM67s" target="_blank">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/205122/#axzz2ae5VM67s</a></p>\r\n	t	2013-08-05 13:36:06	\N	2013-08-05 13:42:16.540208	2013-09-04 14:49:53.542624	48	\N

And, as interest around online video grows, so has the real-time bidding (RTB) market.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy? Both media buyers and publishers are becoming more comfortable with the process, as buyers on the exchange are using more advanced technology to take on more bids at a faster pace than before. This is great news because it is important for buyers to fully understand how they can make the most effective real-time bids for their brand. According to our Director of New Media, Chris Grech, &ldquo;Thus, savvy marketers need to treat this small but valuable marketing element carefully to maximize ROI by taking the following points into consideration as they plan their campaigns:&rdquo;<span id="cke_bm_99C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Reach the audience that matters most.</strong> Don&rsquo;t waste the time and money spent to create your video advertisement on the wrong online audience. Leverage data pulled from both on and offline data sets (such as point of sale, social media, videos, local web pages, music, and online magazines) to reach the right audience.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Remember this is a contextual environment.</strong> Work with a buyer to understand the content of the video your ad will be running with. Make sure the video content is not negative or does not contain information you would not want associated with your brand.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Remember the 80/20 rule.</strong> The majority of sales come from a fraction of stores, products or services and marketers are already maximizing broadcast, print and online advertising efforts. Use online video bids to deliver messaging to the most loyal consumers to increase purchase frequency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs online video and the real-time bidding market continues to grow, marketers need to compile real, actionable data to create campaigns that complement offline efforts and reach the right online audience with messaging that motivates consumers to head in-store and make an offline purchase.

By 2014, the web will be influencing $1.4 billion worth of in-store sales, according to Forrester Research. And, about 62% of shoppers say they search for deals online for at least half of their shopping trip, according to a survey by Booz &amp; Co. and the Grocery Manufacturers Association.</p>\r\n	<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that consumers are researching products and deals online before heading to the store. By 2014, the web will be influencing $1.4 billion worth of in-store sales, according to Forrester Research. And, about 62% of shoppers say they search for deals online for at least half of their shopping trip, according to a survey by Booz &amp; Co. and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf consumers are taking the time to research online, then imagine the time they&rsquo;ll invest shopping once they get to the stores. So this leads me to ask, what can stores do to keep these shoppers in their stores longer and lead to more purchases? Check out some of our tips below.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Offer Plenty of Shopping Carts and Baskets</strong><br />\r\nIt may seem like the obvious, but carts and baskets can slow customers down and keep them in the store longer. And, they can help increase the amount of products customers buy. Even if stores are small, they should still offer some type of basket or bag to help carry their items &ndash; customers can only fill their arms so much but a basket offers so much more room for products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Surprise Customers</strong><br />\r\nThese days, retailers need to get creative and design their stores in a way that confronts shoppers with items that pique their interest and keep them browsing. For example, in Urban Outfitters, a shopper may come across a stack of new books while shopping for pants. Displaying signs throughout the store to advertise special deals may also help direct customers to new areas and shop longer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Hire Great Staff</strong><br />\r\nA welcoming staff will make customers feel good and believe it or not, will help them stay longer. The key is to make sure all customers are treated the same and given equal attention whether they buy or not. Stores like Trader Joe&rsquo;s have staff walking around carrying a giant question mark so customers know where to go for questions. And Apple, has a special Genius Bar featuring experts to handle tech support and offer opinions on gadget needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Make Customers Comfortable</strong><br />\r\nIf customers walk into your store carrying extra bags or heavy coats, store associates should offer to put some of those items aside while they shop. This will help make customers comfortable and have free arms to buy products off shelves or racks. Stores should also consider creating a safe play area for children to help with their family shoppers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>In-Store Demonstrations and Videos</strong><br />\r\nWhether it be a video lesson or an in-store demonstration of a new product, both tactics will help keep shoppers in stores longer. For example, Williams-Sonoma hosts cooking classes in stores, and Guitar Center offers weekly recording lessons for customers. Small businesses, like a beauty store, can even have a makeup artist come in to show customers new makeup products while they shop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Engage Consumers&rsquo; Senses</strong><br />\r\nFree food samples, live music, light aroma sprays, and product demos can entice customers and keep them in the spending mood. Some stores refer to companies like ScentAir Technologies to spray aromas in various parts of their stores. For example, the infant apparel section may get the baby powder scent, and a swimwear section may be filled with the scent of coconut.</p>\r\n	t	2011-09-20 15:29:37	\N	2011-09-20 15:29:37	2013-08-28 16:50:12.470597	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, retail, Alicia Johnston, shoppers, in-store, in-store traffic, tips, in-store sales, Forrester Research, Booz & Co., Grocery Manufacturers Association

Viewers have responded by consuming a whopping 200+ videos per month across thousands of sites. Marketers are fueling the demand by investing in this emerging format thanks to overwhelming evidence that online video is at least as effective, if not more, than broadcast.&nbsp; Additionally, it&rsquo;s an economical way to extend broadcast reach and frequency curves among light TV viewers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is great news for the entire industry! Consumers get access to more quality, on-demand content, publishers increase revenue streams, and marketers shift more budgets to online video.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite all of this growth, the reality is pre-roll video only accounts for 2% of all impressions served on the web. Thus, savvy marketers need to treat this tiny, yet extremely valuable, marketing element carefully to maximize ROI. Here are three ideas to take advantage of this growing audience:<span id="cke_bm_98C" style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Utilize offline data to make your media decisions.</strong> Statistically, the buying power of 220MM American consumers far outweighs panel data that drives the majority of online advertising decisions. As look-a-like and cookie-based targeting continues to erode offline data sets become far more powerful.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Remember the 80/20 rule.</strong> The majority of your sales come from a fraction of your stores, products or services.&nbsp; Marketers are already blanketing the country or a market through broadcast, print and online efforts. Focused messaging to your most loyal consumers will continue to increase their purchase frequency and stay with your brand.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make your video investment work harder for you.</strong> You&rsquo;ve already spent a great deal of money producing the beautiful commercial being shown on television and online. The Internet allows you to easily have the conversation you want to have with your consumer in the environment that makes them most comfortable. Simply adding interactive elements will drive far more viewer engagement if they choose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt&#39;s time to intelligently harness the power of this growing phenomenon by complementing your broadcast, out-of-home and local print efforts with the ideas above.</p>\r\n	t	2012-03-16 13:37:54	\N	2012-03-16 13:37:54	2013-09-29 19:02:14.712403	51	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Chris Grech, online video, video, online video advertising, digital, video consumption, offline data 
869	1	37	television-and-mobile-friends-or-foes	Television and Mobile: Friends or Foes?	<p>Many advertisers have been aware of the multi-screen advertising trend for a while. If you aren&rsquo;t already on top of it, then you&rsquo;re missing out on one of the best opportunities you have for building your brand.</p>\r\n	<p>Almost everyone in my office is obsessed with the same TV show. It&rsquo;s one of those water cooler programs that compel you to talk about the characters, the plot, and how each episode ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Multi-screen usage" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDgvMjEvMDhfMzZfMTRfODY4X011bHRpc2NyZWVuXzE1MHgxNTAucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Multiscreen_150x150.png" style="float:left; height:130px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; width:130px" />But despite the captivating story, most of us don&rsquo;t give it our undivided attention. I asked several coworkers, and it turns out that more than half of us had our phones or tablets fired up during the show. I&rsquo;ve personally lost multiple chess matches over the course of the series!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I admit it&rsquo;s a small, non-scientific sample size, but we&rsquo;re certainly not unique. A report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) claims that, while watching TV, up to &ldquo;77% of tablet owners between the ages of 18-44 years old say they are likely to be multi-tasking.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many advertisers have been aware of this trend for a while. They call it <em>multi-screen advertising</em>, and if you aren&rsquo;t already on top of it, then you&rsquo;re missing out on one of the best opportunities you have for building your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can You Sell to a Distracted Audience?</strong><br />\r\nWhen I first thought about it, I figured multi-screen behaviors would be bad for brands. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t an advertisement need to take center stage to be effective?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out the answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; In fact, message retention may increase due to multiple simultaneous exposures across screens. For example, imagine watching a Yankee game on TV while researching player stats on your iPad. During your research, you see an advertisement for macaroni and cheese. At the same time, you overhear a message from the same brand during the game&rsquo;s commercial break. The next time you go grocery shopping, odds are good you&rsquo;ll remember this brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the convenience of mobile devices makes it easier for TV viewers to immediately research a product without having to leave their couches. The IAB report found that 47% of tablet users are likely to take subsequent action after seeing a commercial on TV. If the same macaroni and cheese advertisement is served to a customer during the game, they can immediately start searching for coupons or deals at their local store. And if they&rsquo;re hungry enough, you&rsquo;ll immediately drive them to the store to fulfill their craving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What About Best Practices?</strong><br />\r\nMulti-screen advertising is still fairly new, but I want to offer two key recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, <em>make sure to integrate your campaigns tightly across channels</em>. If your mobile ads clash with your TV campaigns, you&rsquo;re likely to leave a negative impression with your customers. They might see both ads within the span of a few minutes&mdash;so it&rsquo;ll be very obvious if the messages clash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, <em>design your ads to focus on the best user experience for the device</em>. For example, click-to-call and click-to-map functionality works best on mobile devices, which customers bring with them while they&rsquo;re on the go. For campaign features that require more typing, such as sign-up forms and registration pages, focus on targeting users on tablet devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multi-screen trend won&rsquo;t disappear. In fact, with the rising tide of millennial shoppers who grew up using smartphones and tablets, multi-screen behaviors will only grow in importance. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t ignore it&mdash;mobile advertising might be the biggest thing to happen to TV advertising since the Super Bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>. <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/The_Multiscreen_Marketer.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.iab.net/media/file/The_Multiscreen_Marketer.pdf</a></p>\r\n	t	2013-08-21 08:08:00	\N	2013-08-21 00:37:04.063009	2013-10-15 13:22:17.262393	52	\N
843	1	20	pulling-strength-from-experience-the-next-generation-of-retail-stores	Pulling Strength from Experience: The Next Generation of Retail Stores	<p>Smart retailers that are ahead of the game learn from past experiences and embrace technology rather than resist or run from it.</p>\r\n	<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how modern technology has such a huge impact on the way we shop&mdash;how it attracts us to a specific store because it is something new and different. Thirty-plus years ago, the most exciting technology in stores was talking registers, calculators on cart handles, and the catalog store concept (which allowed you to see and try a sample item that a warehouse then fulfilled and shipped to you). Twenty years ago it was in-store touch screen directory kiosks to help you find an item and the beginnings of what is now the loyalty card. Ten years ago, the self-checkout became mainstream along with ordering out-of-stock items from a computer in the store with direct-to-home shipping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach decade by itself seems pretty boring compared to today&rsquo;s technology standards, which allow stores to incorporate mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets into the shopping experience. However, today&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar stores are returning to these older concepts and simply updating them with a modern flair. &ldquo;Showroomers&rdquo; want to see an item, touch it, or use it before purchasing it&mdash;paralleling the old catalog store concept&mdash;only now, they want to use their smartphones to snap the bar code, find who has the best price, read product reviews, learn the stock status, and purchase the item.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers want data at their fingertips, so brick-and-mortar stores are giving it to them. Smart retailers are posting everything you can find on your phone, in the store. Download their in-store app and you&rsquo;ll find store layout plans as well as aisle numbers to search for items. Why is this important? According to Nathan Pettyjohn, CEO of aisle411, about 20% of in-store retail sales are lost because shoppers can&rsquo;t find items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso within these in-store apps, retailers have added prices, store hours, bar code scanners and even coupons as an incentive to buy in the store. Hmmm, sounds like the directory kiosks and loyalty cards of the past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd who wants to wait around to check out or to find out if the item is in stock? No problem; retailers are empowering any employee to check stock availability, pull/hold inventory, ship from a different location, or process an order from their very own smartphone. That sure adds some personal attention back into the equation from the self-checkouts and self-order kiosks of the past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that history repeats itself in one form or another, and retailers that are ahead of the game realize this and embrace the technology rather than resist or run from it. Sure, e-commerce challenged physical stores at first, and the naysayers saw this as the apocalyptic end to brick-and-mortars. But rising from the ashes is the next generation of physical stores, revisiting old strengths, pairing them with today&rsquo;s technology, and attracting even the most avid online shoppers&mdash;if only because it is something new and different.</p>\r\n	t	2012-12-07 18:22:26	\N	2012-12-07 18:22:26	2013-09-10 14:51:01.783898	59	retailers, brick-and-mortar stores, in-store apps, smartphones

How many retailers have we seen hang up their hats in a woe-is-me surrender to the digital age? And how many retailers have we seen flourish? We&rsquo;ve seen both, and the ones who have risen from the doldrums of the e-commerce era have adapted. The ones who have crashed and burned, have not. Simple. What isn&rsquo;t simple is how the strong have survived. It&rsquo;s taken a lot of change and faith in doing things in a different way. These evolutionary superstars have seen an opportunity in the showrooming phenomenon brought on by advances in mobile technology and have used it to their advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<u><a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000017090588_ExtraSmall.jpg"><img alt="Mobile devices bridge the digital and in-store shopping experiences" src="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000017090588_ExtraSmall.jpg" style="border:0pt none; float:right; height:258px; padding-bottom:10px; padding-left:10px; width:298px" title="Mobile devices bridge the digital and in-store shopping experiences" /></a></u>To help drive more in-store sales and combat showrooming, today&rsquo;s retailers are turning to mobile devices in hopes of bridging digital and in-store shopping experiences. According to July 2012 research from <a href="http://www.e-tailing.com/" target="_blank">the e-tailing group</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mobile Mystery Shopping Study,&rdquo; certain cross-channel features may help US retailers deliver more positive shopping experiences for smartphone and tablet-toting shoppers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe group found that in the second quarter of 2011, more than half of retailers with mobile web store locators enabled geolocation from the site. That number was up to 82% a year later, in the second quarter of 2012. Locating specific products via a mobile device before heading to a store might be even more advantageous for information-hungry, time-crunched shoppers. About half of retailers enabled that function via mobile websites as of this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn-store pickup is another added experience retailers are beginning to implement. The e-tailing group found that in 2011, only 22% of retailers offered the capability to purchase a product via mobile or online and then pick it up in store. By the second quarter of 2012, 34% of US retailers had enabled the pickup function.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA June study by <a href="http://www.retailsystemsresearch.com/" target="_blank">Retail Systems Research (RSR)</a> also demonstrates that retailers are giving more thought to cross-channel activities. According to RSR data, about half of retailers worldwide enabled shoppers to buy online then pick up in store. And 63% allowed shoppers to buy in-store, and then fulfill through online or direct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe e-tailing group lists &ldquo;implementing [mobile] site improvements&rdquo; on the checklist for meeting the needs of today&rsquo;s on-the-go shopper. Marrying mobile experiences with in-store ones might boost consumer opinions of retailers and lead to more frequent purchases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClearly, in-store experiences are still very important to shoppers. However, recognizing that shoppers visit many channels before they make the ultimate purchase is crucial for today&rsquo;s brick-and-mortars. In fact, a comScore and dunnhumbyUSA study showed that digital advertising lifted in-store CPG sales by 20%. And, Forrester Research predicts the web will be influencing $1.4 trillion worth of in-store sales by 2014. Smart retailers have already adapted and know that hyperlocal digital advertising incorporated into their overall mix helps drive additional in-store traffic and sales.</p>\r\n	t	2012-12-20 16:53:15	\N	2012-12-20 16:53:15	2013-09-10 14:52:54.744182	59	in-store sales, mobile advertising, retailers, showrooming, MaxPoint

Forrester further investigated what changes we can expect to see and below is a recap of their predictions.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Better response to more relevant ads.</strong> Digital ad content and timing is going to be key &ndash; meaning it&rsquo;s going to become more relevant to consumers. Why? Because marketers are going to get more and more targeted at reaching their customers. To give you an example, some sites currently has the ability to target&nbsp; subscribers by demographic information, geography, content preference, daypart, or media device (e.g., video gaming console). So just imagine what will be possible in the next few years!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Media buying and selling systems will change dramatically.</strong> The need for new campaign and inventory management systems is going to be necessary to plan, buy, and optimize across channels. You may be aware of a recent merger of MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems into MediaOcean &ndash; this is just one example of the types of change to come in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Adaptive marketers will buy audiences across platforms.</strong> According to Forrester, &ldquo;Adaptive marketers, versed in both TV and digital video vocabularies and currencies, will be able to buy and compare audiences across platforms.&rdquo;&nbsp; By using a balance of digital video impressions and linear TV spots, Forrester predicts that marketers will be able to measure their unduplicated reach across all video media against their target audiences. To learn more about adaptive marketing, you can read a recent AdAge <a href="http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/adaptive-marketing-set-big-thing/232673/" target="_blank">article</a> for more information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Budgets focused on objectives.</strong> We can expect more objective-based budgets &ndash; this will allow marketers to focus on delivering on a single marketing objective. To give you an example, Pepsi&rsquo;s consumer engagement team has a budget that&rsquo;s only focused on building engagement across multiple media channels. They still have separate planning teams for TV and digital, but each operates with the same engagement strategy in mind. Another example comes from Delta Air Lines &ndash; they have separate marketing budgets for brand messaging and tactical objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Flexible creative.</strong> We all know video advertising opportunities are spreading across other technologies such as tablets and smartphones &ndash; so what is does this mean for the future? It means advertisers will have to adapt creative to run wherever their customers are. And it means they will need to be more flexible with their advertising formats and specifications in order for ads to work across various platforms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Media teams fluent in both TV and digital video.</strong> It&rsquo;s no surprise that most TV media planners and buyers these days aren&rsquo;t fluent in digital video and vice versa. With the rise of more integrated marketing teams, single video teams will exist that fully speak the language of both TV and digital video and can plan and buy across both without a hitch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of these predictions are already taking place and you may be seeing some of these changes occurring in your marketing and media departments. As a reminder, be sure to start complementing your TV and other offline media strategies with digital video.</p>\r\n	t	2012-03-15 19:58:39	\N	2012-03-15 19:58:39	2013-10-01 15:10:41.877558	51	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, Alicia Johnston, Forrester Research, digital, digital advertising, advertising, digital video strategies, video, targeting, media buying, media selling, media stats, AdAge

A recent Forrester report revealed some answers to this question &ndash; let&rsquo;s look at what their research discovered.</p>\r\n	<p>By 2015, online advertising is expected to make up nearly 28% of total US major media ad spending, compared to TV, whose share of total spending is expected to hover around 38% for the next five years, according to eMarketer. If this is the case, then why are marketers and media agencies slow to integrate their online video and TV strategies? A recent Forrester report revealed some answers to this question &ndash; let&rsquo;s look at what their research discovered:<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Old media habits and traditional thinking still controls TV budgets</strong>. Forrester interviewed marketers and ad sellers and learned many of them still stick to their traditional media habits and are &ldquo;reluctant to upset the TV advertising status quo to embrace new digital metrics, placements, and innovations.&rdquo; Nielsen data hasn&rsquo;t changed much in 30 years and TV ads are still bought and sold based on this data. And with TV still having the audiences marketers are looking for, and delivering expected decent results, it&rsquo;s easy to stick with it &ndash; however the smart strategy is to use digital video to complement traditional offline media plans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Marketers don&rsquo;t think digital video has the scale</strong>. More and more research is validating how online video positively effects brand lift and purchase intent. However, according to a MediaPost article, marketers are still seeking tangible performance results to prove the impact of digital video. A 2011 Forrester report on marketing mix modeling states, &ldquo;Marketing mix models, the tools that marketers use to measure marketing return on investment, still lack the required data to quantify the effects of digital video on marketing key performance indicators and business goals.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Media and marketing teams operate independently</strong>. Any media agency and marketing department will tell you they have channel-specific teams, and tend to work independent of one another. TV and digital each have their own budget, and there are different skill sets required to plan and buy media for each. Take a look below at a graphic from Forrester that depicts this conflict. What also tends to happen is marketers will partner with different media agencies for their TV and digital media buying needs, further separating these teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORBLOG2.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2006" src="http://www.maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FORBLOG2-300x203.png" style="height:203px; width:300px" title="FORBLOG2" /></a><br />\r\nSo if you&rsquo;ve been wondering why media agencies and marketers are still separating their TV and digital video strategies, I hope this helps you understand why, and maybe gives you some ideas on what you can do to help merge these strategies.&nbsp; Digital video strategies should complement your traditional offline media plans, not detract from them.&nbsp; For instance, take a look at this past <a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/onpoint-blog/2012/02/07/you-just-spent-3-5-million-on-your-super-bowl-ad-now-what/" target="_blank">post</a> on what to do with your TV Super Bowl creative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about how MaxPoint can help you with your digital video strategies, <a href="http://www.maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-solutions" target="_blank">click here</a>.

We&#39;ll show you why&mdash;and give you tips on how to reach them.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDgvMjkvMTFfNDJfMTVfNDU0X0Jsb2dfb25fTWlsbGVubmlhbHMucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Blog-on-Millennials.png" style="float:left; height:116px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; width:116px" />MaxPoint&rsquo;s most recent <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/advertising-tips-and-strategies/advertising-insights/preparing-for-the-golden-years" target="_blank">Interest Index</a> presented clear profiles for both retirement planners and financial services spenders. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised by the findings&mdash;both groups are well established and have more money than younger shoppers. But as a millennial, I was curious about my generation&mdash;are we good targets for financial advertisers, too?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think so, for a few key reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, our generation is massive. Often called the &ldquo;echo boomers,&rdquo; we have numbers reminiscent of the post-WWII baby boomers. It would be unwise to ignore a group that includes upward of 77 million potential customers.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, we may be more financially conscious than previous generations. A 2012 bankrate.com survey found that millennials are more likely than boomers to have a higher share of savings than credit card debt.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> I think this can be attributed to the recession&mdash;the economic situation taught my generation how important fiscal security really is. We may have less money than older Americans, but we&rsquo;ve already developed strong saving habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, we start saving for retirement earlier than other generations. According to a MediaPost report, the average age that millennials start saving for retirement is 22, but most boomers didn&rsquo;t start until 35.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> In short, the moment we enter the workforce, we start saving for the golden years. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, banks and financial services firms can reach millennials while we&rsquo;re still young. Because we often don&rsquo;t have solid brand preferences yet, we&rsquo;re more receptive to your message. And once we do choose a bank, chances are good that it will be our go-to for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tips for Reaching Millennials</strong><br />\r\nSo, banks and financial services firms need to target the younger crowds. But how do they do it successfully? Let me offer just a few words of advice, coming from a member of the millennial generation:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Buy Mobile Placement&mdash;</strong>We&rsquo;re obsessed with our phones. Even when we&rsquo;re watching our favorite shows, we still text friends, play Candy Crush, or <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/8/21/television-and-mobile-friends-or-foes" target="_blank">research something we saw on TV</a>. Every campaign should include some mobile and tablet buys, but with a millennial-focused campaign, you should devote an even larger share of your budget.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Focus on Savings and Security&mdash;</strong>We&rsquo;re fiscally cautious. Keep this insight in mind when putting together your creative&mdash;focus on promoting your brand as the safe, solid choice. Messaging about high investment returns won&rsquo;t resonate as much as ads touting the ability to securely build our nest eggs.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Target Areas That Over-Index for Young Professionals&mdash;</strong>Not all millennials are ready to start saving and investing. So, make sure to use multiple data sources to target neighborhoods that over-index for young professionals. They&rsquo;ll have both the willingness and the ability to buy. You&rsquo;ll see even higher returns if you leverage MaxPoint&rsquo;s interest data to target young professionals with an interest in finance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m not trying to dissuade financial services advertisers from targeting more established boomers or people in Gen X. To the contrary, you should aim the bulk of your ad budget at the profiles from the recent Interest Index. But I do think it would be a mistake to avoid my generation entirely. Just remember&mdash;if you invest in us now, your company will likely profit for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>. <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/the-millennial-count/" target="_blank">http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/the-millennial-count/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/consumer-index/survey-shows-savings-triumphs-debt.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/consumer-index/survey-shows-savings-triumphs-debt.aspx</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>. <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/200287/careful-kids-affluent-gen-y-spend-less-invest-m.html#axzz2TMmU2Tak" target="_blank">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/200287/careful-kids-affluent-gen-y-spend-less-invest-m.html#axzz2TMmU2Tak</a></p>\r\n	t	2013-08-29 08:55:39	\N	2013-08-28 20:57:21.567558	2013-10-15 13:21:03.824588	54	\N

Families have so many choices these days, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what restaurants could do to increase loyalty.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Provide Quality Food</strong><br />\r\nAccording to an <a href="http://www.rmgtmagazine.com/news/changing-demographics-and-brand-appeal-put-pressure-casual-dining?page=2" target="_blank">article</a> in Restaurant Management Magazine, price is not the only factor for families. In this article, University of Louisville marketing professor Wayne Jones, states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a price/quality dynamic. If you&rsquo;re putting out good food at $12 a plate, you&rsquo;ll do better than if you charge $9 a plate for mediocre food.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Create a Family Atmosphere</strong><br />\r\nYou don&rsquo;t have to turn your restaurant into an amusement park, but restaurants should consider a kid-friendly atmosphere. The Old Spaghetti Factory, which has an antique vibe to it, offers a trolley car, pasta choices served in a trolley-themed bowl, and cool &ldquo;bed booths&rdquo; build from old headboards. Red Robin has a wacky mascot and balloons for all kids, and places like Chuck E. Cheese&rsquo;s offer an arcade, games, prizes, and is decorated with bright colors and pictures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Offer an Appealing Menu Selection</strong><br />\r\nWhen selecting a restaurant, Moms almost always choose a restaurant based on the attractiveness of a menu (albeit quality, variety, healthfulness and sophistication), according to a survey to Moms by the <a href="http://usfoodsight.purpleplanet.com/industry-insights/building-your-restaurants-family-appeal.html" target="_blank">US Food Service</a>. In this survey, 86% of Moms said it&rsquo;s important for a restaurant to have food their kids or family likes and 63% say it&rsquo;s important that healthy food choices are offered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Consider Parents Too</strong><br />\r\nMaking parents feel comfortable is also key to keeping families coming back. Restaurants should make sure servers are well trained to be polite and patient with children, and provide children with crayons, paper, and small toys at the table. Offering something as simple as sippy cups and bibs helps parents when they may forget these items. Mimi&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; gives bibs and hand wipes to all families with young kids, and they also make sure all restrooms have changing tables. Conveniences like this will help keep parents happy and loyal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf restaurants consider these kid-friendly factors, they should be well on their way to keeping families coming back over and over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterested to see what 10 restaurants Parents.com named as the &ldquo;Best Family Restaurants of 2011&rdquo;?

So&hellip;retailers, what can you do for these brave shoppers? Make the holiday in-store shopping experience as pleasant as possible.</p>\r\n	<p>For many shoppers heading to the mall around the holidays is not an easy feat.&nbsp; Breaking a sweat just trying to get through the parking lot, the task does not get any easier with crazy store crowds and battles over toys once in-store. However, this hustle and bustle is expected around this time of year and as consumers, we&rsquo;ve accepted it, continuing to head in-store every holiday season. So&hellip;retailers, what can you do for these brave shoppers? Make the holiday in-store shopping experience as pleasant as possible. Below are ten ways you can bring shoppers holiday cheer this year. <!--more--></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Be kid-friendly!</strong> Make the lives of shoppers who bring their children in-store a little easier by providing a kid-friendly environment. Offer an in-store day-care service and give parents an hour away to shop, hands-free. Not equipped for a day-care service? Try providing kid-friendly carts for parents with children or pass out treats or toys to keep kids occupied.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Make use of digital displays.</strong> Entertain and engage in-store shoppers with digital displays. For example, <a href="http://www.macys.com/?cm_mmc=GOOGLE_Trademark-_-Macys+Trademark+Exact+-+G_Macy%27s-_-7652215760_Exact-_-macys._mkwid_sD8ZWkSIK_7652215760|-|D8ZWkSIK" target="_blank">Macy&rsquo;s</a> Believe Stations use digital elements to give shoppers one unique and entertaining holiday experience. More <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/macys-introduces-augmented-reality-experience-in-stores-across-country-as-part-of-its-2011-believe-campaign-2011-11-02" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Provide coat/bag checks.</strong> Most shoppers will be hitting multiple stores at once, which means lugging around heavy bags in addition to outdoor winter gear. Provide shoppers with coat/bag checks and let them shop around in your store with ease. Free arms = more hands to pull items off shelves, into the cart and onto check-out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Give out samples.</strong> Make purchase decisions faster by offering samples of your products. Sell food and beverage items? Pass around trays with food and beverage samples. Not only will it ease hunger pains during shopping (eliminating the desire to leave the store for food) but allow shoppers to walk away knowing they purchased exactly what they wanted. Sell games?&nbsp; Provide a station where shoppers can play the latest games and even compete against other shoppers for bragging rights or the rights to that toy they might be fighting over.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Be equipped with full staff/extra cashiers</strong>.&nbsp; A full staff is key during the holiday shopping season. Multiple hands can help multiple shoppers, eliminating crowds faster and pleasing shoppers by making it easy to find and have a store representative ready to answer questions. Also, remember to open up all possible checkout lines and even find ways to provide additional ways to checkout. Consumers accept it, but the last thing they want to do during the holidays is wait in lines. For alternative checkout options, see this <a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/resource-center/51-white-papers/1194-enabling-smarter-commerce-mobile-point-of-sale-and-mobile-commerce-stores" target="_blank">article</a> on mobile checkout.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Offer free wrapping.</strong> Trying to find the right present for everyone in the family is hard enough and unless you are a super pro at wrapping, many struggle and do not look forward to this daunting task. Bring a smile to shoppers&rsquo; faces as they notice free wrapping stations after checking out. Now, that&rsquo;s a line worth waiting in.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Put up store directories.</strong> Larger stores, department stores in particular, can be hard to navigate. Provide shoppers with store directories so they can get to where they are going faster. And, make it festive too! Provide arrows to the hottest holiday items or use holiday icons for &ldquo;you are here&rdquo; markers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Strategically organize popular items.</strong> As we&rsquo;ve touched on again and again, crowds are common during the holiday shopping season. Strategically place popular items far enough away from each other to avoid creating mob-like mentality in one area of the store.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Offer incentives for coming in-store.</strong> Let shoppers know you appreciate them coming in-store by offering incentives. For instance, use social networks like <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> to let shoppers gain points towards a store reward every time they check-in in-store. Or&hellip;offer discounts only available in-store. Either way, shoppers will be happy you are thinking of them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Be merry!</strong> Good customer service is key to pleasing shoppers, especially during the holiday shopping rush. Unhappy employees = unhappy shoppers. So listen to that holiday music loud on the way to work and get ready to spread cheer to everyone in-store.

For many consumers, it&rsquo;s a day of hiding at home or rushing to stores as soon as they open, trying to grab the sweet deals offered before anyone else. For retailers and brands, it&rsquo;s a day that can significantly lift retail sales and drive high in-store traffic. And, this year, retailers are coming out full force. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the <a href="http://www.nrf.com/" target="_blank">National Retail Federation</a> (NRF), &ldquo;the <a href="http://www.retailwire.com/discussion/14897/when-black-friday-comes" target="_blank">rules for Black Friday</a> have changed significantly.&rdquo; Instead of waiting until Thanksgiving Day to announce Black Friday deals, retailers are already creating buzz around what&rsquo;s to come for their shoppers. And, why not? This year, approximately 138 billion people plan to shop over Black Friday weekend (four million more than last year).&nbsp; And, a recent <a href="http://www.retailwire.com/" target="_blank">RetailWire</a> poll found that 64% think that early promotions can be a big advantage for retailers this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, how are retailers stepping it up this year in their stores?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n\t<li><strong>Early openings:</strong> Sears, Kmart, Macy&rsquo;s, Walmart, Toys &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us, Bass Pro Shops, Target and several other stores are opening some or all of their stores on Thanksgiving!

The report said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Retailers feel the challenge the most in stores. The store is getting pinched between other selling channels that steal away transactions, while the traditional media channels that used to work best to drive traffic to stores are becoming less and less effective. However, for every challenge there is an opportunity, and for stores one of the most important is local.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retailers should evaluate their local digital advertising strategy in order to determine new ways to drive foot traffic and sales at their physical stores. Technology now allows retailers and brands to provide central control over brand promise, while also allowing retailers and brands to bring back the local flavor to different store locations. And, retailers are noticing the importance of embracing this, with the RSR research report revealing the top five &ldquo;local&rdquo; advertisers to be Macy&rsquo;s, J.C. Penney, Sports Authority, Best Buy and Kohl&rsquo;s. By reaching potential customers at the neighborhood level with digital campaigns, retailers can get much more targeted and serve the right ads to the right customers at the right time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a recent <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/comscore-and-dunnhumbyusa-research-shows-online-advertising-lifts-in-store-cpg-brand-sales-2011-10-11" target="_blank">report</a> from comScore, online digital campaigns drive a 21 percent increase in offline store sales.&nbsp; Doing a print buy, is a very involved process, with digital it is a very quick, very scalable process to buy multiple markets in one swoop with a 15-20 percent return. However, there has not been a digital solution that allows brands or retailers to use digital to drive traffic to a specific retail store. With MaxPoint&rsquo;s digital targeting technology, we have the ability to target small areas and can do specific radiuses around the retail stores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what can we take away from this? The neighborhood matters! This holiday season, especially in the critical 72 hours before the 2011 holiday shopping season ends, think local and drive in-store sales with your digital campaign.</p>\r\n	t	2011-11-09 14:26:37	\N	2011-11-09 14:26:37	2013-10-11 16:55:14.636164	49	National Retail Federation, MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, local, retail, brand, localization, brand strategy, Retail Systems Research, local digital advertising, digital, digital advertising, Macy's, J.C.

We&#39;ll show you how in the final installment of our digital measurement series.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="OnPoint Measurement Series" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTAvMjMvMDhfMjJfNDNfODkyX0Jsb2dfTWVhc3VyZW1lbnRfU2VyaWVzXzUucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Blog%20Measurement%20Series_5.png" style="float:right; height:290px; margin-left:45px; margin-right:45px; width:300px" />In our most recent posts, we&rsquo;ve covered several methods for measuring the effect of a digital campaign, including <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/18/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-1" target="_blank">sales lift studies</a> and <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/10/15/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-brand-lift-and-engagement" target="_blank">brand engagement surveys</a>. Today, we&rsquo;ll conclude our measurement series with audience match studies, which allow you to measure how efficiently you reached your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many sophisticated advertisers know that their sales will increase if they simply reach enough of their intended audience. Of course, they want to reach those consumers while keeping wasted impressions at a minimum. That&rsquo;s where audience match studies enter the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience Match Studies </strong><br />\r\nIn an audience match study, a third-party research firm uses data from a research panel to discover the audience makeup for an ad campaign. The firm can tell how many people received the ad, how many matched the audience profile, and how many impressions were mismatched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research firm treats the panel as a representation of the national population. However, the researchers use a statistical model that corrects for groups that are under- or over-represented in the panel. For example, if the panel includes only 25% females, while the US population is closer to 50%, the researchers will adapt panel scores to give more weight to the female scores on the panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An audience match study generally produces two key metrics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Percentage In-Target<strong>&mdash;</strong>This is the share of a campaign&rsquo;s total impressions delivered to the target audience. For example, if 30 impressions out of a total 100 impressions for the campaign were served to the target audience, then the percentage in-target would be 30%. Percentage in-target can vary widely depending on the industry and background of the advertiser.</li>\r\n\t<li>Target Efficiency<strong>&mdash;</strong>This measures the percentage, expressed as an index of 1, of the number of impressions served to the target audience compared to the total number of people within the target audience online. A campaign is considered efficient if the target efficiency score is higher than 1. For example, if you were focused on suburban mothers, and you reached twice the percentage of suburban mothers with your campaign than you would via general web-based targeting, then you would have a target efficiency of 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>The Pros and Cons of Audience Match Studies</strong><br />\r\nAudience match studies provide several key benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Verify your targeting. Most digital providers offer targeting measurements in their post-campaign reports. In an audience match study, the third-party research firm verifies the results reported by your digital provider.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get an indication of sales. While the studies don&rsquo;t use direct sales data, high target efficiency scores indicate high sales.</li>\r\n\t<li>Discover results for a reasonably low price. If you don&rsquo;t have the budget for a sales lift study or a brand engagement survey, an audience match study can work as a cost-effective alternative.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOf course, there are also drawbacks. Audience match studies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Provide no sales data. If you want to put dollar figures on your sales, you&rsquo;ll have to run a sales lift study. &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Give no brand engagement data. Even if you reach your perfect audience, you still need to make sure your message resonates. The best way to measure this is with a brand lift study. &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Require that you know your audience. Your target audience should be clearly defined before you run an audience match study. If you lack clear customer profiles, an audience match study will provide little benefit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Audience Match Studies in Action</strong><br />\r\nOver the years, we&rsquo;ve run several campaigns alongside audience match studies. One example was our work with a major CPG brand that sells packaged breakfast foods. We targeted Hispanic mothers between the ages of 18 and 49. The CPG brand set a benchmark target efficiency of 1.6. With this in mind, the third-party research firm tested MaxPoint&rsquo;s targeting capabilities for the campaign. The firm found that the campaign produced a target efficiency of 3.9, which was 2.4x the CPG brand&rsquo;s benchmark score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which Measurement Studies Work for You?</strong><br />\r\nThis concludes our series on digital advertising measurement. We wrote this series to introduce you to all the methods you have at your disposal for measuring a digital campaign. No matter what your advertising goal or your budget, there&rsquo;s a measurement study that can meet your current needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now it&rsquo;s your turn&mdash;how are you currently measuring your digital ad campaigns?

And, this should not be overlooked, since great service drives in-store-sales and customer loyalty.&nbsp; &nbsp;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was recently in the market for a new tennis racquet.&nbsp; Wanting to be well informed, I did a lot of online research to determine the best racquets for my skill level and price point.&nbsp; While searching several sites, ads were continually displayed for a local tennis shop that has an indoor demo court.&nbsp; I thought, wow, they really want me to visit their store.&nbsp; This was the best-case scenario, because I could research racquets online in the comfort of my home and then have the option to try them out at the store on an indoor court.&nbsp; Perfect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other hand, I walked through the front door of this eager retailer to nearly bump into a &ldquo;greeter&rdquo; that I assumed would point me in the right direction.&nbsp; No eye contact.&nbsp; Not even a hello. So, I navigated through the large store by myself and found the indoor court in the back corner.&nbsp; No one is around to help me.&nbsp; I help myself to the court and find the exact demo racquets in which I was interested &ndash; but they have a security device attached.&nbsp; I sought out an employee from the apparel department and she reluctantly asks if I need help.&nbsp; She is not able to answer any of my questions and has no idea how to remove the security device from the racquet.&nbsp; She pages the &ldquo;tennis pro,&rdquo; who, upon his arrival, made it clear he was preoccupied with something in the back room.&nbsp; He was not only arrogant but also unwilling to give five minutes of his time to answer my questions.&nbsp; To ignore a customer in such a manner, I can only assume Andre Agassi was in the back seeking this guy&rsquo;s infinite &ldquo;pro&rdquo; wisdom.&nbsp; He did take off the security devices though &ndash;so I was able to demo the racquets.&nbsp; I found one I liked, and to my surprise, it was offered at the same price as an online tennis warehouse retailer.&nbsp; So, I could get the instant satisfaction of having my racquet the same day without waiting for it to be shipped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, guess what, because I was so annoyed by the level (or absence) of service, I walked outside, pulled out my iPhone and ordered from the tennis warehouse retailer; same price, free 2-day shipping.&nbsp; Had I experienced good service, I would have certainly purchased my racquet in the local store and became a loyal customer.&nbsp; Not to mention all of the positive word-of-mouth recommendations I would have given to my friends and family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the advanced and creative efforts of the online advertising to get me into their store, this retailer failed miserably at closing the sale -- all because of poor customer service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a recent Consumer Reports survey asking 1,010 adults about their customer-service experiences, 64 percent of respondents said they have left a store in the past year because of poor customer service. This survey is part of a larger investigation on customer service featured in the July 2011 issue of Consumer Reports and online at <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm" target="_blank">www.ConsumerReports.org</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the same report, retail industry consultant Jack Abelson describes the state of customer service in the U.S. today as &ldquo;abominable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He attributes the decline to corporate America&rsquo;s focus on cutting costs instead of increasing revenue. &ldquo;There is an almost complete failure to recognize and appreciate the value people can bring to the equation,&rdquo; says Abelson, who terms good customer service &ldquo;a profit producer.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe moral of the story, if you are going to invest in digital advertising to drive in-store sales, don&rsquo;t forget to train your staff in top quality customer service &ndash;because a sale without an attitude is only a click away!</p>\r\n	t	2011-10-07 21:02:31	\N	2011-10-07 21:02:31	2013-10-23 17:45:48.410758	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, Lynn Vitello, OnPoint, customer service, in-store sales, customer loyalty, Consumer Reports, Jack Abelson

To celebrate this fun time of year, we issued the results today of an indexing study that analyzed billions of data points to determine the US neighborhoods with moms most interested in back-to-school lunches. <!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt turns out Las Vegas has the highest concentration of moms looking for and purchasing back-to-school lunch products, and we also revealed that there are two distinct types of moms when it comes to preparing lunches for their children. There are those who enjoy making lunches from scratch and those who prefer quick, easy and convenient meals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Las Vegas, Nevada, for example, &ldquo;homemade&rdquo; moms dominate the Whitney neighborhood while the Plymouth area outside of South Bend, Indiana, has a high concentration of &ldquo;on-the-go&rdquo; moms. This information is extremely valuable to grocers, food manufacturers and CPG companies that are looking for new ways to reach moms through digital shopper marketing and advertising campaigns. By using a hyperlocal approach, these brands can reach the right audience for their products &ndash; whether they are ingredients for putting together a lunch from scratch or kid-friendly prepackaged lunches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe top 10 cities that show the greatest interest in back-to-school lunches are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Las Vegas, NV</li>\r\n\t<li>South Bend, IN</li>\r\n\t<li>Greenwood, MS</li>\r\n\t<li>Anchorage, AK</li>\r\n\t<li>Fresno, CA</li>\r\n\t<li>Chicago, IL</li>\r\n\t<li>Houston, TX</li>\r\n\t<li>Twin Falls, ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Yuma, AZ</li>\r\n\t<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nUsing the data gleaned from this August Interest Index, we implemented hyperlocal digital ad campaigns geared toward specific moms:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A regional restaurant chain with a line of farm-fresh food products wanted to drive coupon downloads for its premade products in grocery stores. We implemented a highly targeted video ad and coupon campaign geared toward moms with kids under the age of 12 who live within a 6&ndash;8 mile radius of the restaurant chain&rsquo;s locations.</li>\r\n\t<li>A large food production company wanted to drive awareness of its new line of on-the-go meals. We created a digital ad strategy targeting moms with kids between the ages of 9 and 17 who previously purchased competitive products within the mini sandwiches category.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;With school starting, moms are looking for new lunch options that fit their families&rsquo; lifestyles. By zeroing in on the neighborhoods that over-index for moms who make homemade versus on-the-go meals, we can help advertisers find the best audience for their products,&rdquo; said Gretchen Joyce, chief operating officer at MaxPoint Interactive. &ldquo;In order to drive in-store traffic, brands can target moms in different neighborhoods with ads that speak to their specific interests and past purchase behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/MaxPoint-Interactive-August-Interest-Index-Infographic.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3161" src="http://maxpointinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/MaxPoint-Interactive-August-Interest-Index-Infographic-248x1024.jpg" style="height:1024px; width:248px" title="MaxPoint Interactive August Interest Index Infographic.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n	t	2012-08-30 13:30:42	\N	2012-08-30 13:30:42	2013-09-17 13:57:46.477156	54	back-to-school, interest index, Digital Zip, neighborhoods, MaxPoint, OnPoint

Over the next few weeks, we&rsquo;re going to talk in depth about how premium studies can help you measure the impact of your digital campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before we pick up that discussion, we should take a closer look at click-through rates (CTRs). They&rsquo;re the yardsticks by which many advertisers currently measure their digital campaigns. But are CTRs enough?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, there are pros and cons to relying on this simple metric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CTRs &ndash; The Beginning of the Story</strong><br />\r\nBecause you can track an online ad easily&mdash;from the number of impressions to the number of clicks&mdash;it&rsquo;s easier to gauge the results of your digital campaigns than those of your traditional media efforts; you simply can&rsquo;t measure impressions and clicks for a roadside billboard or a print ad in the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because you have some metrics, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean you have the entire story. Clicks in particular are only the beginning. In fact, there are two key pitfalls to standard CTRs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They Don&rsquo;t Measure Offline Sales&mdash;If you&rsquo;re selling anything offline, then you simply can&rsquo;t stop at CTRs. They can&rsquo;t measure the number of people who go to your stores, nor can they measure a direct impact on sales. CTRs are great for driving people to landing pages that allow you to track conversions, but they fall short for offline sales. For anything other than ecommerce, you have to go beyond CTRs to truly close the loop on offline sales.</li>\r\n\t<li>They Don&rsquo;t Measure Brand Impact&mdash;CTRs are really just proxies for measuring engagement. They indicate a strong brand engagement, but don&rsquo;t directly measure it. It&rsquo;s always possible that you built an advertisement with a high CTR that doesn&rsquo;t actually help your brand. Even if you get a lot of people clicking, they may not remember the message. To really get at brand impact, you need to run a brand lift survey.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt comes down to a simple idea&mdash;clicks aren&rsquo;t your end goal. You want sales or brand impact, not clicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are some reasons to keep tracking CTRs. First, they&rsquo;re great barometers for basic engagement. They&rsquo;re not perfect, but a campaign with a higher CTR often indicates stronger brand engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, they&rsquo;re a better measurement option for smaller or shorter campaigns. Both sales lift studies and brand lift surveys require a large amount of impressions. Additionally, sales lift studies require that campaigns run for at least three months, preferably more. So, if you&rsquo;re running a quick campaign, perhaps to spend some extra budget to boost sales for Black Friday, then you are far better off using basic stats like CTRs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Final Word on CTRs</strong><br />\r\nUltimately, CTRs are better than nothing. But if you have the budget, we definitely recommend trying a premium study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next week, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/18/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-1" target="_blank">sales lift studies</a>.

The interview focuses on media buying and what media buyers/planners take into consideration when developing an advertising budget. &nbsp;<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> As you know, the digital advertising industry has exploded with the emergence of new technology. What do media buyers/planners take into account when evaluating new technology?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Yang:</strong> First, we evaluate if the technology solves a problem and what kind of problem it solves. Second, we ask ourselves if the technology differentiates itself from the competition and if the technology actually works. Case studies are a good indicator to see if the new technology works, as long as they are relevant to whoever is looking into the new technology. Lastly, we evaluate what the costs are and what the technology maturity is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> What do you feel is most important for media buyers/planners to take into consideration when figuring out where to allocate ad spend?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Yang:</strong> Media buyers and planners should take into consideration how efficient the media is (on both a pricing &amp; performance level) that is being purchased. Another consideration would be the potential impact for our clients in achieving their objectives. For instance, their objectives may not be getting the lowest cost per click or highest conversion rate but maybe they want to be on the homepage of NYT. It is about assessing the true value and then how do we measure that value.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur team would say customer service too &ndash; we work with people or publishers that we like and know will have good customer service. For instance, we consider if people or publishers are timely in responses and if they have good analytics insights ready when a campaign runs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also think word of mouth plays a big component for media planners. If another media planner lets you know that a particular vendor or publisher is easy to work with and gets the job done &ndash; that makes a big difference.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> What are some of the challenges media buyers/planners face when they want to execute a campaign across multiple marketing channels on a limited ad budget?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Yang:</strong> With a limited budget, you have to make sure you are using the best channels for a client. First we assess what are the client&rsquo;s goals and what is the most efficient route for reaching the goal. If the focus is on SEM or display tactics, we leverage what we know will work and which publishers will work the best. Then we go from there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other challenge is spreading your budget across too many things &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want to do that. There is so much that can be touched and the market is so fragmented and there are so many different types of opportunities. Knowing what will work best for a client can be a huge challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhenever we do a plan we have a pretty good idea of projected conversion rates and click through rates. We also can reference historical campaign data and what the pricing/historical performance was. That makes it easier when evaluating new campaigns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>MaxPoint:</strong> Since most campaigns focus on a specific audience, how do media buyers/planners tackle finding solutions for effective audience targeting during the campaign planning process?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Yang:</strong> There are a lot of different solutions out there &ndash; probably more than a dozen that claim some sort of experienced audience targeting, whether it is offline/online or a combination of both. Again it goes back to our historical experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe look at performance from a clickthrough and conversion rate and we want to understand the methodology for targeting and what sort of sources they are gathering from audience targeting. To eliminate companies, it is trial and error, and figuring out what works best.

Discover how you can measure sales impact in dollars in the first of two posts on sales lift studies.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMTgvMDhfMzJfNDFfMzI4X0Jsb2dfTWVhc3VyZW1lbnRfU2VyaWVzXzIucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Blog%20Measurement%20Series_2.png" style="float:right; height:290px; margin-left:45px; margin-right:45px; width:300px" />Last week, we covered <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/12/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-the-conundrum-of-clicks" target="_blank">the pros and cons of relying on click-through rates (CTRs)</a> for measuring your digital advertising campaigns. In short, they&rsquo;re a good start, but they don&rsquo;t tell the entire story for a digital ad campaign. If you want the complete picture, you&rsquo;ll have to opt for a premium measurement tool, such as a sales lift study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales lift studies measure campaigns using real sales data, typically comparing test and control groups over a time period or in a specific area. If your campaign&rsquo;s goal is to generate strong sales for a product, this is the study that will tell you if you reached your goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sales lift study:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>One or more digital advertisements are served to a test group.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sales data are collected from stores or consumers in both the test group and a control group.</li>\r\n\t<li>The difference in sales between the test and control groups equals the sales lift.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running a campaign promoting a brand of cola. You might decide to run ads in St. Louis as a test, but avoid advertising in Kansas City. If you see higher sales figures in St. Louis, then odds are good that your campaign played a major role in lifting sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sales Lift Methods</strong><br />\r\nAlthough the process above is fairly simple, there are actually three different styles of sales lift studies. They differ in how they collect data&mdash;and that&rsquo;s also what changes their price tags. The three styles are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Panel-based studies</li>\r\n\t<li>Point-of-sale studies</li>\r\n\t<li>Retail-partner studies</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEach study type has various pros and cons. This week, we&rsquo;ll focus on the consumer panel data studies. Next week, we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at point-of-sale and retail-partner studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Panel-Based Studies</strong><br />\r\nWhen most people think of sales lift studies, panel-based studies come to mind. These studies provide incredibly accurate and detailed data. However, they work only for lengthier campaigns and are often costly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a panel-based study, a research firm maintains a research panel of consumers. To participate in the panel, the consumers answer detailed questions about their demographics and background. Additionally, the panel members have software that tracks their Internet usage, which allows the researchers to match an ad impression to a particular user. To measure sales data, each panel member scans receipts to a central database, which tracks and stores their purchases. The researchers cross-reference all three data points to discover if an advertisement moved the right consumers to buy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These studies offer a number of interesting benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>They provide an exact sales number. It&rsquo;s much easier to know the value of your campaign if you can put a dollar figure on the results.</li>\r\n\t<li>They allow you to calculate other in-depth metrics. The sales figures can be used to calculate other metrics, such as estimated customer lifetime value, upcoming sales figures, and ROI.</li>\r\n\t<li>They give insights into the audience<strong>. </strong>With data on the participants&rsquo; backgrounds, researchers can give better insights into responder profiles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, these studies do have some drawbacks. They can be expensive due to the intensity of the data collection and the amount of research labor required. Additionally, the studies must run for a long period of time, typically at least three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What About Other Sales Lift Studies?</strong><br />\r\nStay tuned for the <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/29/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-2" target="_blank">next post</a>, in which we discuss some of the less expensive sales lift studies including point-of-sale and retail-partner studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Want to Wait?</strong><br />\r\n<a href="http://offers.maxpoint.com/measurement" target="_blank">Download our free measurement guide</a> now to learn more about putting your digital campaigns to the measurement test.</p>\r\n	t	2013-09-18 13:26:42	\N	2013-09-18 13:30:05.541638	2013-10-15 13:18:09.170981	62	\N

In addition, Hispanic households spend more on groceries than other groups and are more receptive to in-store promotions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Single-person households:</strong> Single-person households have tripled and account for 27 percent of U.S. households. As a result, brands are providing grocers with more single-serving packages and providing packages with fewer servings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Baby boomers:</strong> Compared to other generations, baby boomers account for the largest share of sales across most product categories. Boomers are more active and health conscious than before, seeking out grocers that provide fresh and healthy food options.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Millennials:</strong> According to an OMD study, millennials born between 1981 and 1995 have 11 percent more buying power than baby boomers did in their youth. Millennials spend most of their time researching online before heading in-store and are identified as extremely tech-savvy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Male shoppers:</strong> Fifty-one percent of men said they are the primary shopper in the family &ndash; as a result, product marketing is becoming more gender neutral vs. being aimed towards moms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more insight into today&rsquo;s grocery shopper, click <a href="http://offers.maxpoint.com/GroceryShopperInsights.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\r\n	t	2012-07-08 10:00:58	\N	2012-07-08 10:00:58	2013-09-18 13:39:40.898058	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, retail, consumers

Digital is becoming a hot advertising channel and it has given brands even more opportunities to become viral and connect with consumers. For example: Coca-Cola.<!--more--><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecently, Business Insider covered a story on Coca-Cola and the brand&rsquo;s success in creating viral video campaigns. As you know, Coca-Cola is well known around the world, and has clearly caught on to the opportunities digital has to offer with over almost 75 million views on its YouTube channel and more than 67k subscribers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, what are some of the keys to creating a viral video? Here are a few tips:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Tell stories:</strong> According to Coca-Cola&rsquo;s svp/global advertising strategy, Jonathan Mildenhall, the main focus behind the brands virality is based on the concept of liquid content. Coca-Cola defines this as, &ldquo;the creation of stories that are expressed through every possible connection&hellip;each story must add value and significance to people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; Stories help consumers make connections and will make a brand more memorable and easier to recall in the long run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Create an emotional appeal:</strong> While Coca-Cola varies the messaging and leverages different events (such as the upcoming Olympic Games) to deliver campaigns, the brand always aims to connect with consumers emotions. According to Mildenhall, &ldquo;Coke wants to show commitment to make the world a better place.&rdquo; To inspire consumers to live positively, each advertisement is aimed to leave viewers with a happy and inspired mood after watching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Listen to your customers:</strong> In order to drive brand sales, it is important to listen to consumers and discover their needs in order to deliver the best brand experience. However, according to Coca-Cola, listening to a consumer is not enough. A brand has to be actively involved in conversation and responding to consumers&rsquo; needs. One way to do this is by leveraging digital and building an online presence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWatch Coca-Cola&rsquo;s viral videos <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-18-best-coke-youtube-videos-2012-6#the-hug-machine-1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\r\n	t	2012-06-21 15:03:49	\N	2012-06-21 15:03:49	2013-09-20 00:16:59.475581	49	MaxPoint, MaxPoint Interactive, OnPoint, digital, digital advertising, viral, brand

Here are a few ways interactive marketing will change advertising:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Focus on customer relationships:</strong> Digital vehicles and interactive tools give us much more of an opportunity to communicate and engage with consumers. For instance, social media networking sites give insight into what consumers are talking about and sharing. It is also a great place for retailers/brands to reach out to consumers directly. In addition, audience targeting technologies enable advertisers and brands to reach consumers online at a very granular level, making sure the right consumer sees an advertisement that is relevant to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Remain open to new technology:</strong> U.S. online advertising is predicted to jump from $39.5 billion in 2012 to $62 billion in 2016. And, as online advertising grows, there will be even more technologies introduced to the market, more consumer insights available and more ways to reach consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Penetrate all media:</strong> According to VanBoskirk, &ldquo;Interactivity is penetrating traditional media and advertising&hellip;Along with changes in media come changes in media buying.&rdquo; Media buyers and planners will have to evaluate the most efficient methods for running a campaign with multiple outlets available. In addition, more media buyers and planners are starting to allocate more ad spend on budgets for digital, while others are learning how to create and optimize cross-channel campaigns.

Try real-time advertising&mdash;it&#39;s easier than you think.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="Coffee" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDkvMjUvMTNfNDhfMDZfODAxX0NvZmZlZS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjgwMHg4MDA%2BIl1d/Coffee.jpg" style="float:right; height:200px; margin:10px 5px; width:300px" /> The most powerful advertisements share one major commonality&mdash;relevance. They speak to your world in the most relevant way possible. When you&rsquo;re hungry, an ad for a burger might be perfect. When you&rsquo;re thirsty, bottled water might do the trick. The closer an ad speaks to your current experience, the more likely it is you&rsquo;ll buy the product. And digital advertising helps you do this better than any other advertising channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, real-time ads have been the talk of the advertising town. And for good reason&mdash;they make use of digital&rsquo;s full potential by making ads far more timely and relevant. Whether you&rsquo;re watching the Oscars or the Indy 500, you feel like the ad is right next to you enjoying the same event. You simply can&rsquo;t do this with print advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while real-time advertising sounds complicated, it can be a lot easier than you think. It just takes the right creative and a little extra planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you run a coffee shop. You could serve ads promoting a cold iced drink when the weather is warm, but promote a warm latte once the temperature drops below freezing. Your creative can even reference the weather: &ldquo;Warm up from the cold with a nice warm latte.&rdquo; The customer is likely already thinking about the weather, so your ads offer her the perfect suggestion for the temperature. When it&rsquo;s cold, it&rsquo;s only logical that you&rsquo;d like to warm up with a nice cup of coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather-based ads aren&rsquo;t the only application for real-time ads. For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a shoe brand. If there&rsquo;s a major fashion show on TV, you can try to serve ads promoting your brand of shoe to customers in areas watching the fashion show. Your customers could receive ads on their smartphones or tablets that promote the shoes right as the model strolls down the catwalk wearing your brand. It&rsquo;s a real-time ad that didn&rsquo;t require any scrambling from a creative agency or the executive team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, advertising is about relevance&mdash;the right location at the right time. Hyperlocal digital advertising already gives you the location piece; now, real-time ads give you time-relevance. And you don&rsquo;t need luck&mdash;with a little bit of planning and the right data, you can serve your ads to customers right when they&rsquo;re perfectly poised to hear them. Digital advertising gives you the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions in the world&mdash;whether you have to swap out creative or simply increase your ad buys in a specific area. By being highly relevant, you improve your response rates while reducing your ad waste. And that&rsquo;s the dream of every advertiser, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n	t	2013-09-20 13:54:41	\N	2013-09-20 13:59:56.634917	2013-10-01 18:07:22.222639	63	\N

Even though most purchases take place in the physical world, people still spend much of their lives plugged into the Web. So this leads to a question: can online advertising drive offline sales?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s campaign with MaxPoint may answer this question. From personal care to health care, Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s products improve the lives of millions. In particular, its Depend<sup>&reg;</sup> brand of adult undergarments provides protection from incontinence issues while giving customers more confidence in their daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Kimberly-Clark wanted to improve sales of Depend at one of its key retail partners, it turned to MaxPoint&rsquo;s proprietary Digital Zip<sup>&reg;</sup> technology. With MaxPoint&rsquo;s help, the brand quickly developed a strategy to target shoppers in key neighborhoods around retail locations. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark decided to test the campaign&rsquo;s results by running a sales lift study using data from its retail partner. But before we get to the results, let&rsquo;s start with the campaign strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining the Perfect Audience</strong><br />\r\nAny good advertising campaign starts with defining the audience. &nbsp;So, we started out by looking for shoppers matching the following profile:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Age: 51&ndash;70</li>\r\n\t<li>Income: $40,000+ per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Interests: bladder health and incontinence relief</li>\r\n\t<li>Purchases: incontinence products<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Armed with this core profile, MaxPoint could then find the right locations that would drive the most sales. To do this, we focused on neighborhoods within six and eight miles of the store. This was the perfect distance&mdash;close enough to reach shoppers who can easily drive to the store, yet large enough to reach enough shoppers to really drive enough sales. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Testing the Sales Results</strong><br />\r\nKimberly-Clark opted to run a sales lift study to discover the sales increase produced by the campaign. It chose a <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/30/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-2" target="_blank">retail-partner study</a>, which used sales data directly from retail partners&rsquo; stores. The study measured purchases of Depend at participating stores during the campaign and over the four-week period following the campaign&rsquo;s completion. Finally, we compared the sales from the study period against historical sales data from before the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the campaign, Kimberly-Clark saw a <strong>21% increase in weekly sales</strong> of Depend products in participating stores. The sales increase occurred both during the campaign and during the four-week post-campaign period. In short, Kimberly-Clark received a major sales boost from the campaign and continued to see benefits for a few weeks after the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results speak for themselves&mdash;digital advertising boosts offline sales. When you combine the right mix of offline and online data sources to find the perfect local shoppers, you&rsquo;re pretty much guaranteed to see your sales increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you run a digital advertising campaign that boosted your offline sales?

Find out with this week&#39;s post on brand lift surveys.</p>\r\n	<p><img alt="Brand Lift Studies" src="/system/editor/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMTAvMTUvMDhfMDdfNTVfOTM3X0Jsb2dfTWVhc3VyZW1lbnRfU2VyaWVzXzQucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI4MDB4ODAwPiJdXQ/Blog%20Measurement%20Series_4.png" style="float:right; height:290px; margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; width:300px" />In our two most recent measurement posts, we covered <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/9/18/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-closing-the-loop-on-sales-part-1" target="_blank">sales lift studies</a>, which use real sales data to put an exact dollar figure on the purchases your ad campaigns generate. Sales lift studies certainly have their time and place, but what would you do if you wanted to measure something less tangible, such as the effect a campaign has on customer attitudes and perceptions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where brand engagement surveys, also called brand lift surveys, come in. These surveys measure engagement anywhere in the sales cycle&mdash;from early awareness to purchase intent to customer recommendation. They&rsquo;re flexible, easy to run, and cost-effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Brand Engagement Surveys Work</strong><br />\r\nMeasuring the impact your digital ads have on brand engagement is surprisingly simple. A quick one-question survey delivered to both test and control groups while your campaign runs is all it takes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you sell a brand of peanut butter. Your ad campaign promotes the brand as an organic and healthy choice. While the campaign runs, you could serve a single-question survey to both a test group (who were served your ad) and a control group (who were not served your ad). If you ask both groups to choose the healthiest brand among several peanut butters and your brand scores higher among the test group than the control group, your campaign produced a positive brand lift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you need to tailor your survey to your campaign goal. MaxPoint uses a standard set of questions, each tailored to different stages in the sales cycle. You can get these questions by downloading our <a href="http://offers.maxpoint.com/measurement" target="_blank">free measurement guide</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Pros and Cons of Brand Engagement Surveys</strong><br />\r\nSo, now that you know the process, why pick a brand engagement survey?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Measure Intangibles&mdash;Customer attitudes are abstract and intangible, but their impact on sales is absolutely real. Brand engagement surveys measure these attitudes in ways that sales lift studies simply can&rsquo;t.</li>\r\n\t<li>Adapt Surveys to Your Objective&mdash;You can tailor surveys to your campaign goal. Simply ask the question that best captures your campaign&rsquo;s goal&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s brand awareness or brand favorability. You can even change your survey mid-campaign, although this will affect your budget and your outcome.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Test Sales Cheaply<strong>&mdash;</strong>Although brand engagement surveys won&rsquo;t provide an exact dollar figure, they can indicate a strong possibility for sales. Simply use a purchase intent question, which asks how likely a consumer is to purchase a product or service, to discover if your ad campaign had a positive effect on sales.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut there are some drawbacks. In particular, brand engagement surveys:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Require Brevity&mdash;An effective survey asks only one or two questions. This keeps responses high, but does limit the number of variables you can measure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t Provide Sales Data&mdash;Purchase intent questions hint at sales lift, but they don&rsquo;t provide a concrete sales number.</li>\r\n\t<li>Can Have Incremental Costs&mdash;You need to reach a minimum number of respondents to produce a valid result. If you don&rsquo;t reach enough customers, you may need to purchase additional impressions. This doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but it is a small risk.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brand Engagement in Action</strong><br />\r\nMaxPoint recently ran a campaign for a major CPG brand. The campaign sought to produce positive awareness of its beverages in markets along the Pacific Coast of the United States. Researchers tested campaign effectiveness by asking consumers to select, from a list of the brand and its competitors, the brand whose ads they remembered seeing online. The campaign produced a 62.3% lift in brand awareness among test groups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ad campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Final Word on Brand Engagement Surveys</strong><br />\r\nDigital advertising does more than just produce sales&mdash;it affects the hearts and minds of a brand&rsquo;s customers. Brand engagement surveys provide a simple and cost-effective way for advertisers to measure these effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our next post, we&rsquo;ll finish our measurement series with a discussion of <a href="http://maxpoint.com/us/digital-advertising-company/onpoint-blog/2013/10/23/measuring-your-digital-ad-campaigns-audience-match-studies" target="_blank">audience match studies</a>.

The in-depth examination includes a look at traditional and digital advertising, alternative offers and website communication in four distinct retail verticals&ndash; department/clothing stores, sporting goods, electronics and casual dining.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe findings provide great insight into how retailers are effectively using localization tactics as part of their digital campaigns, as well as how many are missing the mark. RSR found that no one retailer has fully taken advantage of this local advertising opportunity.&nbsp; For instance, department stores notably outperformed the other verticals, but can do more to bring a sense of &ldquo;local&rdquo; into their stores. In addition, electronics retailers successfully leverage social channels, but still have far to go as it relates to video, mobile and alternative social branding. To address this, RSR has provided four specific recommendations that will help retailers create more cohesive local campaigns that reach consumers at every touch point of their path to purchase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWant to learn more about how far retailers have come in local advertising and how far they have left to go?
